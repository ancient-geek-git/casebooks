      <p class="TextParagraph">Although litigation is often thought of as the core lawyering function, most lawyers, most of the time, are not actually in court advocating on behalf of clients. Rather, they are working outside of court, attempting to resolve disputes or structure prospective relationships in ways that protect their clients’ interests. This chapter explores the ethical dimensions of two types of non-litigation roles that lawyers play: as negotiators and mediators. Of course, in practice, negotiation and mediation are related, though subtly different, concepts. In a negotiation, the focus is on lawyers as client representatives, while in a mediation, <span style="font-style: italic;">parties</span> to a dispute attempt to negotiate an agreement, assisted by a neutral mediator. The focus of this chapter is on the different roles <span style="font-style: italic;">lawyers</span> play in these negotiation and mediation contexts. We will first examine the ethical responsibilities of lawyers as client representatives bargaining with third parties or their counsel in order to reach agreement. We then consider the ethical obligations of lawyers as mediators, when they serve as third-party neutrals seeking to help parties resolve disputes out of court.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861631" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219185" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756591" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908277" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908725" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Negotiation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">More than 95 percent of both criminal and civil cases conclude without trial. Some are dropped by a party or dismissed by a court, but the overwhelming majority are resolved via negotiated settlements. The number of civil cases that are tried to verdict has declined from 20 percent in 1938 to a meager 1 percent today.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1524" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1524" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> As Marc Galanter points out, “negotiation is not . . . some unusual alternative to litigation. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> litigation. There are not two distinct processes, negotiation and litigation; there is a single process of disputing in the vicinity of official tribunals that might fancifully be called LITIGOTIATION.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1525" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1525" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers also bargain in a broad variety of other non-litigation settings on matters such as contracts, taxes, employment, housing, and divorces. Theorists often distinguish “dispute negotiation”—negotiation to settle disputes about past events—from “transactional negotiation”—negotiation to structure future arrangements. Both forms of bargaining <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page706" class="pagebreak" title="706">706</span>take place “in the shadow of the law.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1526" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1526" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span> In dispute resolution, if the negotiators fail to reach agreement, the case may result in litigation; accordingly, the parties can evaluate each other’s offers by estimating the likelihood and dollar value of a favorable outcome at trial, together with the costs of achieving it. In transactional negotiations, parties’ choices and bargaining leverage are often shaped by background legal entitlements and available future remedies. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A key threshold question is whether to engage in negotiation in the first place. The central issue is “compared to what.” This involves calculating what experts refer to as BATNA: the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1527" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1527" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> To make that evaluation, parties need to understand their most significant interests and goals: What are they trying to achieve and why? And they need to predict the consequences of negotiating or refusing to negotiate.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1528" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1528" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This section explores key ethical responsibilities—and ambiguities—that arise when parties have chosen to negotiate. We first survey the ethical context, paying close attention to the professional rules governing negotiation activities and highlighting how they interact with different negotiation styles. The section then drills down on two central ethical challenges for lawyers in negotiations: coercion and candor.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861632" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756592" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908726" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ethical Context</p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Professional Framework</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most negotiation involves the strategic use of bargaining power and asymmetrical information. As a consequence, negotiations often raise difficult questions for lawyers about pressure tactics and disclosure obligations. These questions implicate various ethical rules and legal doctrine concerning fraud, extortion, and other misconduct. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 4.1 (discussed in Chapter 7 in connection with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Garza</span> case), governs “truthfulness in statements to others.” It provides guidance regarding what lawyers can say—and what is appropriate for them <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to say—while negotiating on behalf of their clients. While Rule 4.1(a) clearly prohibits lawyers from knowingly making “a false statement of material fact or law to a third person,” the rule is less clear concerning when <span style="font-style: italic;">nondisclosure</span> of information constitutes an ethical violation. Rule 4.1(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 4.1(b)&quot; \s &quot;4.1(b)&quot; \c 16 " /> makes lawyers subject to discipline if they knowingly “fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6,” which is the rule requiring confidentiality. However, as we will see, what constitutes a “material fact,” what it means <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page707" class="pagebreak" title="707">707</span>to assist a client crime or fraud, and when exactly confidentiality applies are all subject to debate.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Also relevant is Rule 4.4(a), which seeks to promote “respect for rights of third persons” by prohibiting lawyers from using “means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person.” This rule constrains tactics that attempt to exploit opponents’ vulnerabilities, such as threatening custody battles in divorce cases or threatening to expose potential criminal liability. Some states have stricter rules against using threats to gain a bargaining advantage, which we discuss in the section on coercion below. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Two other professional conduct rules are particularly relevant in negotiation settings. Rule 1.2(d)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(d)&quot; " /> provides that a lawyer may not “counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.” And Rule 8.4, sections (c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4(c)&quot; \s &quot;Rule 8.4, sections (c)&quot; \c 16 " /> and (d)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4(d)&quot; \s &quot;Rule 8.4, sections (c) and (d)&quot; \c 16 " />, prohibits lawyers from engaging in “conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,” or other conduct “that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.” </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Keep these rules in mind as you read the negotiation materials that follow. In this discussion, we will also reference other authorities, particularly the ABA Section of Litigation’s Ethical Guidelines for Settlement Negotiations, which was published in 2002 (ABA, Ethical Guidelines).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1529" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1529" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> These Guidelines provide the ABA’s best interpretation of ethical rules that relate to negotiation practice; unlike the states’ Rules of Professional Conduct, however, they do not create binding obligations that can form the basis for professional discipline.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Negotiating dynamics are affected not only by rules of conduct, but also by lawyers’ own ethical values and bargaining styles. Because so much negotiation takes place in the absence of formal oversight, a lawyer’s own internal sense of honesty and fair dealing plays a critical role. In evaluating the appropriateness of bargaining conduct and the professional rules that regulate it, consider the following principles.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Universality: “Could I recommend that everyone in my situation act this way?”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Reciprocity: “Would I want others to treat me this way?”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Transparency: “Would I be comfortable if I read about what I had just done on the front page of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall Street Journal</span>?”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1530" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1530" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Styles of Negotiation</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Many of the ethical problems arising in negotiation result from the view that successful bargaining requires an adversarial stance. Some experts, however, believe that a cooperative approach to bargaining is not only more ethical, but also, often, more effective.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1531" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1531" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Advocates of cooperative negotiation claim that high ethical standards and a collaborative approach enhance opportunities for creative, mutually advantageous solutions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In essence, the key technique of cooperative negotiation is to avoid getting overly invested in a client’s bargaining position, and to look instead at the underlying needs and interests that led the client to assert the position in the first place. That way, negotiators may be able to achieve their clients’ ends without getting trapped in competitive game-playing. Major principles of cooperative bargaining include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element74" />Appeal to objective criteria, such as principles and standards that the other party views as legitimate, rather than merely trading offers in a test of will and skill.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element75" />Make the goal of the negotiation the highest realistic expectation of what can be achieved; do not allow your client’s bottom line to become the main reference point.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element76" />Stay focused on the client’s real needs, not winning the competition or getting the most money. It is often possible to satisfy those needs without getting the best financial settlement, and thus without turning negotiation into a zero-sum game. Lying about clients’ true position can prevent opportunities for mutually beneficial resolutions. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element77" />Instead of reaching a stalemate over one central issue, try to place another concern on the table, one that matters more to the other side than to your own client, so that concessions can be traded. (The usual name for this technique is “logrolling.”) Ask open-ended questions to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page709" class="pagebreak" title="709">709</span>identify potential interests. The key to cooperative negotiation is reciprocity and logrolling among issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element78" />Remember that issues other than money may be less obvious but more divisive. Avoid letting questions of control, turf, ego, and reputation sabotage an otherwise acceptable bargain.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1532" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1532" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A key concern among those who prefer cooperative approaches is whether they will work when the other negotiator is non-cooperative. The answer is a qualified “yes.” In these situations, successful negotiators adopt four basic strategies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element79" />They never initiate the use of “dirty tricks” or hardball strategies; <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element80" />they don’t let the other side use such tactics without retaliating in some form; <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element81" />after retaliating, they don’t hold grudges—they return to a “no-first-use” policy on exploitative strategies; <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element82" />they make it plain to the other side that their strategy follows the first three rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextFlush">In short, successful cooperative approaches are <span style="font-style: italic;">nice, provokable, forgiving,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">transparent.</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1533" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1533" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> A bargainer who follows these rules will occasionally risk being exploited by a non-cooperative adversary. However, research has shown that if negotiators encounter each other in repeat transactions or have knowledge of their adversary’s reputation, non-cooperative negotiators will be “punished” for excessively competitive and aggressive past behavior.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1534" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1534" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> Within communities of repeat players, cooperation works better over the long run.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1535" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1535" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> When asked what style of negotiation is effective, lawyers overwhelmingly rate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page710" class="pagebreak" title="710">710</span>cooperative/problem-solving (54 percent) over competitive/adversarial (9 percent).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1536" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1536" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet, as experts also note, there are complexities in defining “effectiveness” that are not captured by the simple cooperative/<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,Times,Baskerville,Georgia,serif;">‌</span>competitive dichotomy. Charles Craver argues that a third type of negotiator is most effective: competitive/problem-solvers who “seek competitive objectives—maximizing of their own returns—but do so in a non-adversarial manner. They also strive to maximize opponent returns once they have achieved their own primary goals.” “They work to create value . . . but then employ disingenuous tactics to claim more of the bargaining surplus than they give to their opponents.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1537" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1537" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> More fully cooperative bargainers can be fooled by this approach. They “reciprocate the seeming openness of [competitive problem solvers] without realizing that their openness is not being entirely reciprocated.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1538" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1538" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> Because the process is pleasant, respectful, and seemingly candid, cooperative bargainers may overvalue the objective results that they actually obtain.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1539" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1539" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Robert Condlin identifies another complexity. He notes that some degree of competition is inherent in the negotiation process; there are adversarial elements even in cooperative bargaining, and sometimes there is no alternative to very hard bargaining. A common “bargainer’s dilemma” involves whether to seek the long-term gains of cooperative bargaining or the one-time advantage that successful competitive bargaining can sometimes confer. In Condlin’s view, the duty of zealous advocacy for a current client may require lawyers to seek the one-time advantage. Otherwise, they are trading off the client’s interests for their own long-term bargaining effectiveness, which benefits only themselves, their future clients, and the present client’s adversary. Such a strategy appears to violate Rule 1.7(a)(2)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.7(a)(2)&quot; " />: “a lawyer shall not represent a client if . . . the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client . . . or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1540" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1540" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Building on such insights, some experts agree with Condlin that it is self-deceiving to think that ethical conduct in negotiation can always be viewed as enlightened self-interest. Lies that are unlikely to be revealed may be highly effective in claiming, if not creating, gains.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1541" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1541" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span> And as Gerald Wetlaufer notes, the world in which we live “honors <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page711" class="pagebreak" title="711">711</span>instrumental effectiveness above all else.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1542" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1542" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>However, Wetlaufer also argues that many of our common excuses for lying are equally self-deceptive. Relying on excuses such as “everyone does it” or “the other side is doing it” presupposes an impoverished view of morality that we would reject in other contexts. Moreover, as other experts note, it is important for negotiators to maintain their own standards of fairness, self-respect, and credibility. Those who stoop to their opponents’ level forfeit both their moral and legal advantage, which may be especially relevant if the bargain is ever challenged. In the long run, unethical practices impair reputations and weaken fundamental values of trust and integrity on which effective lawyering depends.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1543" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1543" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>As social psychologists note, reputations are “sticky” because people tend to remember information that confirms preexisting impressions; once developed, reputations are relatively easy to maintain, but once tarnished, they are hard to repair.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1544" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1544" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span> Even in law school negotiating classes, students who are perceived as misrepresenting positions end up with more unsuccessful negotiation outcomes by the end of the semester.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1545" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1545" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the same time, it is also important to minimize clients’ risk of suffering exploitation when bargaining with parties who appear willing to cut ethical corners. The risks are greatest in one-shot bargaining contexts where the stakes matter greatly and reputations or relationships do not. Commonly recommended strategies of self-protection include:</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Other differences in negotiation styles reflect cultural differences and group identities.

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Gender and Negotiation Styles </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Over the past several decades, a large body of theoretical and empirical research has attempted to determine whether men and women have different negotiating styles and levels of effectiveness. Despite this extensive literature, there are large gaps and inconsistencies, as well as frequent overgeneralizations from the limited findings available. Many studies involve college students or young and inexperienced adults in unrealistic, simulated, one-shot settings that hold limited relevance for lawyer negotiators.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1548" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1548" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Granting such limitations, a number of common findings from this body of research can shed light on negotiations involving attorneys. One takeaway is that gender is mediated by other aspects of the negotiating context, including participants’ relative social status, perceived power, and attitudes toward conflict.<span style="font-weight: bolder;" class="sup"><a id="ftnb.1549" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1549" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> Other relevant factors include whether negotiators are the same sex, whether they have negotiating experience or ongoing relationships, and whether they are acting for themselves or as representatives for clients or third parties.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1550" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1550" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> Women tend to do better when acting for others, in part because they are more likely to be viewed negatively than men when they bargain for themselves on matters such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page713" class="pagebreak" title="713">713</span>as compensation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1551" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1551" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> On the whole, however, in contexts involving lawyers where assertiveness on behalf of clients is expected, no consistent differences between female and male negotiators’ effectiveness emerge.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1552" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1552" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Women and men do, however, display certain distinctive strengths. Women are generally rated higher than men on some of the qualities that are useful in negotiation. One is social intuition, including the ability to read others and build rapport.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1553" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1553" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> Another is empathy, including skills in listening and appreciating others’ interests and concerns.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1554" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1554" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Some research also finds that women negotiators are more likely than men to disparage ethically questionable tactics and are less likely to lower their ethical standards, even when doing so would benefit them financially.<span style="font-weight: bolder;" class="sup"><a id="ftnb.1555" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1555" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> Men, by contrast, are freer to behave assertively without fear of backlash.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1556" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1556" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> They also have higher levels of confidence, which can be helpful in <span style="color: #000000;">setting high goals, persisting in the face of opposition and self-presentation.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1557" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1557" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> However, men are also more likely to display overconfidence, which can impair listening, alienate opponents, and undermine effectiveness.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1558" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1558" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is important to note that these average differences do not predict differences in individual cases, and many differences are less pronounced among lawyer negotiators who have training and experience in effective bargaining techniques. Still, acknowledging real gender differences—and surfacing and debunking myths—can help level the negotiating playing field. Research demonstrates that making women aware of mistaken stereotypes about their bargaining styles and abilities can improve their performance.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1559" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1559" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> </p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">This section examines what it means for lawyers to be both ethical and effective in negotiation for clients. We focus on two central challenges. The first—<span style="font-style: italic;">coercion</span>—involves situations in which lawyers advance arguments or employ tactics that pressure opposing parties to accept agreements that may offend notions of fairness or legitimacy. The second challenge relates to <span style="font-style: italic;">candor.</span> Here, the question is how much <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page714" class="pagebreak" title="714">714</span>information a lawyer must or should disclose to ensure an outcome that serves clients’ interests without offending standards of procedural fairness. </p>
      <p class="TextHeadParagraph">
        <a id="_Toc451861636" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <a id="_Toc36219190" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Coercion</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Consider the “ultimatum bargaining game”: Rich and Poor are offered $1,000 to divide as they choose, provided that they agree on a division. If they don’t, neither gets a cent. Rich offers Poor $100, threatening to walk unless Poor accepts. Since Rich can afford to make good on the threat, and Poor needs the money, Poor accepts. Is this a coercive or otherwise unfair use of bargaining power?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">At the outset, it is important to note that whether or not hardball bargaining strategies meet the legal definition of “coercion,” research confirms that they seem unfair to most people. In one study, subjects played a version of the ultimatum bargaining game where players received a sum of money to divide. The first player was given one chance to make an offer, and the second player had one opportunity to take it or leave it (in which case, both players would get nothing). The study revealed that, although most people are unwilling to forego all advantages of superior bargaining power, most are also unwilling to exploit it fully or to accept such tactics by an adversary. Specifically, a quarter of first players proposed a 50–50 split, and the average first player offer was a 67–33 split. Only 10 percent of first players demanded more than 90 percent of the money—and in almost all of those cases, second players refused the offer, despite the fact that doing so cost them money. In a similar study, where subjects observed other players in action before playing ultimatum with them, three-fourths of the subjects preferred splitting a small amount of money with a “fair” player over splitting a slightly higher amount with a “hardball” player.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1560" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1560" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> Such research suggests that exploitative bargaining can be ethically offensive and tactically unwise, even if it is legally permissible.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> hardball bargaining legally permissible? Contract law permits some forms of coercion in bargaining—as when a negotiator threatens to withhold goods or services from a party who will not agree to a price. But the law invalidates contracts when they are the product of “duress.” The <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement of Contracts</span> defines “duress” as:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />any wrongful act of one person that compels a manifestation of apparent assent by another to a transaction without his volition, or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />any wrongful threat of one person by words or other conduct that induces another to enter into a transaction under the influence of such fear as precludes him from exercising free will <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page715" class="pagebreak" title="715">715</span>and judgment, if the threat was intended or should reasonably have been expected to operate as an inducement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1561" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1561" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Part (b) adopts what theorist Alan Wertheimer labels a “two-pronged” theory of duress. Wertheimer argues that two conditions must be met for an offer or a threat to qualify as duress. First, the statement must leave the victim no reasonable choice but to acquiesce. Second, it must be independently wrongful.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1562" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1562" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> So, for example, exploiting a party’s vulnerability may be coercive without constituting duress if the offer was not fraudulent or otherwise illegal. However, some types of coercive tactics rise to the level of duress, such as when a negotiator threatens to breach a prior agreement that would “place the victim in a position in which breach would cause noncompensable damage.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1563" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1563" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Although the line between legitimate coercion and unlawful duress is murky, versions of this theory inform not only the law of contracts, but also the law governing crime, torts, marriage, and wills.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1564" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1564" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An additional question for lawyers is when using coercive tactics or arguments in advancing client interests exposes lawyers to professional sanction. Of course, under Rule 1.2(d), if a lawyer were to “counsel . . . or assist” a client in coercive behavior that the lawyer knew was “criminal or fraudulent,” the lawyer could be subject to discipline. Similarly, if the lawyer’s engagement in coercive negotiation involves “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,” or is deemed “prejudicial to the administration of justice,” the lawyer could be held to violate Rule 8.4(c) or (d). Additionally, to the extent that coercion served “no substantial purpose” other than to “burden” an opposing party, a lawyer could risk sanctions under Rule 4.4(a).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In this regard, one question that commonly arises for lawyers in negotiation is whether it is proper to threaten to exercise a legal right in order to gain a negotiation advantage. For example, can a lawyer in a civil case threaten to initiate criminal proceedings against an adversary in order to pressure the adversary to settle?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">The Model Code, in place until the Model Rules replaced it in 1983, prohibited lawyers from threatening to present criminal charges to law <span style="font-size: 10pt;">enforcement </span>personnel “solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1565" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1565" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> However, that prohibition was dropped from the Model Rules because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page716" class="pagebreak" title="716">716</span>drafters considered it overbroad, redundant (in light of Rules 8.4, 4.4, and 4.1), and also unrealistic, as many lawyers reasonably discuss potential criminal liability in negotiations over related civil claims.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1566" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1566" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> Accordingly, the Model Rules now adopt a more permissive attitude toward the use of criminal threats. In particular, <a id="dabmci_fbed354d313041beada0107325898a3d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Opinion 92–363 (1992) concludes that a lawyer may use the possibility of pressing criminal charges against an opposing party in a private civil matter to gain relief for the client, provided that the criminal matter is related to the civil claim, that both the civil claim and the possible criminal charge are legally and factually justifiable, and that the lawyer does not attempt to exert improper influence over the criminal process. A lawyer may also agree as part of a settlement to <span style="font-style: italic;">refrain</span> from presenting criminal charges against an opposing party so long as the settlement agreement does not violate existing law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other hand, some jurisdictions continue to adhere to the Model Code’s position and prohibit lawyers from threatening opposing parties with criminal sanctions in order to gain a financial advantage.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1567" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1567" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> For instance, the D.C. Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(g) states: “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . [s]eek or threaten to seek criminal charges or disciplinary charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter.” </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Meanwhile, while most states now permit lawyers to threaten an opposing <span style="font-style: italic;">party</span> with criminal prosecution (as long as the threat is legally and factually justified), most states continue to hold that lawyers may <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> attempt to gain a tactical advantage by threatening disciplinary charges against an opposing <span style="font-style: italic;">lawyer</span>. <a id="dabmci_d2934df775c7415e8baefef33bfbaef5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />In Formal Opinion 94–383 (1994), the ABA Ethics Committee concluded that a lawyer’s threat to report opposing counsel to disciplinary authorities in order to obtain an advantage in a civil case may violate the Model Rules, even though no Rule expressly prohibits such threats. Under the Committee’s analysis, filing disciplinary charges may not be used as a bargaining chip if the misconduct raises a substantial question as to opposing counsel’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer because reporting is already mandatory under such circumstances under Rule 8.3. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Chapter 3, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When is it ethically permissible for a lawyer to make threats in negotiation that, while not exposing the opposing party to criminal sanction, nevertheless raise serious risks that exert powerful pressure to settle? Consider this issue in the context of the following discussion of negotiating a divorce settlement in which one party uses the threat of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page717" class="pagebreak" title="717">717</span>challenging custody rights in order to reduce his financial support obligations.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc451861637" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219191" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756594" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908728" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Richard Neely, “The Primary Caretaker Parent Rule: Child Custody and the Dynamics of Greed”</p>
      <p class="FileLine"><a id="dabmci_5ec7612b06a044f6ac7c61687b3f59f9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3 Yale Law &amp; Policy Review 168, 177–79 (1984)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Neely, Richard, The Primary Caretaker Parent Rule: Child Custody and the Dynamics of Greed, 3 Yale Law &amp; Policy Review 168 (1984)&quot; \s &quot;3 Yale Law &amp; Policy Review 168, 177–79 (1984)&quot; \c 13 " />.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A [divorcing] parent concerned with paying as little child support as possible can use the threat of a custody fight, with its never-certain outcome, as a lever during settlement negotiations. The result is that one parent—typically the father—winds up paying less in child support than the needs of the child or children warrant, while the other parent—typically the mother—is forced to scrape by on inadequate support, a problem exacerbated by the generally lower earning power of women. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Divorce decrees are typically drafted for the parties after compromises reached through private negotiation. These compromises are then approved by a judge, who generally gives them only the most perfunctory sort of review. The result is that parties (usually husbands) are free to use whatever leverage is available to obtain a favorable settlement. In practice this tends to mean that husbands will threaten custody fights, with all of the accompanying traumas and uncertainties discussed above, as a means of intimidating wives into accepting less child support and alimony than is sufficient to allow the mother to live and raise the children appropriately as a single parent. Because women are usually unwilling to accept even a minor risk of losing custody, such techniques are generally successful.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To make these abstract statements more concrete, I would like to use an example from my own experience. My first encounter with the manner in which the unpredictability of divorce proceedings can be used to terrorize women came early in my career as a small-town lawyer.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1568" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1568" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> My client was a railroad brakeman who had fallen out of love with his wife and in love with motorcycles. Along the way, he had met a woman who was as taken with motorcycles as he. After about a year, my client’s wife filed for divorce. My client had two children at home—one about nine and the other about twelve. Unfortunately for him, the judge in the county where his wife had filed her suit was notorious for giving high alimony and child support awards. The last thing that I wanted to do was go to trial. The wife had a strong case of adultery against my client, and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page718" class="pagebreak" title="718">718</span>best my client could come up with was a lame countersuit for “cruel and inhuman treatment”—not exactly a showstopper in a rural domestic court.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During the initial interview, I asked my client about his children, and he told me that he got along well with them. He also indicated, however, that two children were the last thing he wanted from his divorce. Nonetheless, it occurred to me in my role as zealous advocate that if my client developed a passionate attachment to his children and told his wife that he would fight for custody all the way to the state supreme court, we might settle the whole divorce fairly cheaply. My client was a quick study: That night he went home and began a campaign for his children. His chance of actually getting custody from the judge was virtually nonexistent, but that did not discourage our blustering threats.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">My client’s wife was unwilling to take any chance, no matter how slight, on losing her children. Consequently, the divorce was settled exactly as we wanted. The wife got the children by agreement, along with rather modest alimony and child support. All we had needed to defeat her legitimate claims in the settlement process was the halfway credible threat of a protracted custody battle. As Solomon showed us, the better a mother is as a parent, the less likely she is to allow a destructive fight over her children.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The above story is more than just a homey example, for it is repeated across the nation every day. Under our purportedly sex-neutral system, women on statistical average come out of divorce settlements with the worst of all possible results: They get the children, but insufficient money with which to support them. They are forced to scrape along to support their families at inadequate standards of living, and the children are forced to grow up poor, or at least poorer than they should be. Yet the dynamic demonstrated above is seldom discussed, despite its importance in promoting the growth of a rapidly-expanding class of poor people, the female-headed household.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In Justice Neely’s example, the mother makes a financial sacrifice because she is highly <span style="font-style: italic;">risk averse</span>: She will not gamble on custody, even if the odds are excellent that she will prevail. A parent who is less risk averse will be less susceptible to what is often called “custody blackmail.” However, there are reasons besides risk aversion to yield to such coercion. One is to spare children the trauma of litigation. A second arises from the “friendly parent” provisions applicable in many states that give preference to the parent who has demonstrated willingness to share custody or to grant more extensive visitation rights. These provisions create a bargaining opportunity for parties interested in minimizing support payments. By demanding joint custody over their former spouse’s opposition, they can qualify as the friendly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page719" class="pagebreak" title="719">719</span>parent. That gives them leverage to trade uncontested custody in return for reduced financial obligations.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The frequency of “custody blackmail” is hard to gauge. The limited evidence available suggests that it is sufficiently common to cause concern and that women are almost always the vulnerable party.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1569" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1569" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> Their vulnerability is compounded by other disadvantages, such as greater risk aversion, lower wage earning capacity, and higher likelihood of dependence and deference in marital relationships.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1570" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1570" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The term “custody blackmail” was obviously coined by opponents of the practice, as it implies that the strategy is always improper. Is it? Can you imagine yourself engaging in this practice? Under what circumstances?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is it unethical for a lawyer to propose “custody blackmail” to a client who has not indicated a desire for custody but who has indicated a desire to minimize his support obligations? Does the appropriateness of the strategy depend on whether the lawyer or the client initially suggests it? Does it depend on whether the other spouse’s financial demands seem excessive? Consider how you would answer these questions under Rules 1.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(a)&quot; " /> and (d)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.2(d)&quot; \s &quot;1.2(a) and (d)&quot; \c 16 " />, 1.4<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.4&quot; " />, 4.4(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.4(a)&quot; " />, and 8.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(c)&quot; " /> and (d)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4(d)&quot; \s &quot;8.4(c) and (d)&quot; \c 16 " />. If a client claims to want sole or joint physical custody, but the lawyer believes the client does not really mean it or should not obtain it, must the lawyer withdraw under Rule 1.16? For guidance, see ABA, Ethical Guidelines § 3.3.3 (providing that lawyers who find a client’s goal or strategy repugnant may withdraw or continue representation on the condition that they will not assist that goal or strategy). Suppose the client wants to negotiate directly with the former spouse? For guidance, see <span style="font-style: italic;">id</span>. § 4.3.3, Committee Notes (indicating that lawyers need not discourage a client’s contact with an opposing party but citing divided authority over whether a lawyer may encourage or advise a client in that contact).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Raoul Felder, a prominent divorce lawyer, described his role as a “technician, a how-to man,” not a “moralist.” “It is not my intention to stand in judgment. . . . [W]hen I take a case, I am not concerned with whether my client is right or wrong. As far as I am concerned, my client is always right.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1571" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1571" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What is your view? Few would argue that clients in the middle of acrimonious divorces are always “right” about what is in their long-term interest.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1572" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1572" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> Particularly where parties will have continuing contact after the divorce, hardball bargaining strategies that have short term payoffs may have larger long term costs. Is it part of a family lawyer’s role to help clients live up to their best, rather than worst, instincts? Or are such efforts an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page720" class="pagebreak" title="720">720</span>inappropriate exercise in paternalism by lawyers who will not have to cope with the consequences?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A growing number of family practitioners address these issues through what they term “collaborative lawyering.” Their aim is to offer a more cooperative form of dispute resolution.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1573" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1573" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> Under this approach, parties commit to collaborate with each other as well as with their lawyers in an attempt at mutual problem solving. Each client is represented by counsel, and each signs a retainer agreement that specifies that the lawyer is to assist them in reaching a fair, out-of-court agreement. If the parties fail to reach such a settlement, the lawyers may not represent them in further proceedings. The clients also commit to act in good faith and to disclose all relevant information. This dispute resolution process involves joint settlement meetings with parties and their lawyers, all of whom have a substantial stake in preserving cooperative relationships and engaging in creative, mutually beneficial problem solving.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What do you make of the above termination requirement? A Colorado Bar Ethics Opinion, Op. 115 (2007), held that agreements requiring termination of representation if the parties do not reach settlement violate Rule 1.7(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.7(b)&quot; " />. Recall, that rule bars attorneys from representing a client where their responsibilities to that client may be “materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to . . . a third person,” unless the lawyer reasonably believes that, notwithstanding the conflict, the lawyer can provide “competent and diligent representation” and the client gives informed consent. According to the Colorado Bar Ethics Committee, client consent could not cure the potential conflict because, whenever the collaborative process is unsuccessful, the lawyers’ obligation to the opponent to withdraw would trump the lawyer’s obligation to pursue the client’s best interest, which might be litigation. Do you agree?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">At least ten other bar ethics opinions, including <a id="dabmci_554c768e929e4471879e3e0692852656" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Op. 07–447 (2007), permit lawyers to enter into termination agreements as part of the collaborative process.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1574" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1574" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> How would you advise a client about the appropriateness of entering into such a collaborative process?

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ethical issues often arise in family law because the interests of children are materially affected but seldom formally represented. To what extent should this fact influence a divorce lawyer’s negotiating strategy? Do existing ethical rules adequately provide for the interests of unrepresented third parties? Consider as an alternative, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bounds of Advocacy: Goals for Family Lawyers</span>, of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, a voluntary association of qualified family law specialists. Goal 6.1 provides that “[a]n attorney representing a parent should consider the welfare of, and seek to minimize the adverse impact of the divorce on, the minor children.” The Comment adds:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">One of the most troubling issues in family law is determining a lawyer’s obligations to children. The lawyer must competently represent the interest of the client but not at the expense of children. The parents’ fiduciary obligations for the well-being of a child provide a basis for the attorney’s consideration of the child’s best interests consistent with traditional advocacy and client loyalty principles. It is accepted doctrine that the attorney for a trustee or other fiduciary has an ethical obligation to the beneficiaries to whom the fiduciary’s obligations run.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">In particular, Goal 6.2 provides: “An attorney should not permit a client to contest child custody, contact, or access for either financial leverage or vindictiveness.” Its Comment states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Tactics oriented toward asserting custody rights as leverage toward attaining some other, usually financial, goal are destructive. The matrimonial lawyer should counsel against, and refuse to assist, such conduct. Proper consideration for the welfare of the children requires that they not be used as pawns in the divorce process. Thus, for example, in states where child support is determined partly on the basis of the amount of time a parent spends with the child, the lawyers should negotiate parenting issues based solely on considerations related to the child, then negotiate child support based on financial considerations. If despite the attorney’s advice, the client persists, the attorney should seek to withdraw.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The Preliminary Statement to these goals makes clear that they “aspire” to a level of practice above the minimum required by the Model Rules but that they should not be used to determine malpractice liability. Should those Rules impose any affirmative obligations vis-à-vis highly vulnerable third parties like children? Alternatively, should bar regulatory authorities or voluntary associations develop certification systems to identify lawyers willing to abide by higher ethical standards?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Commentators have proposed a variety of metrics to assess “fairness” in negotiation. One is to assess substantive results by criteria such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element87" />Equality: participants share equally in benefits and burdens;</li>

      </ul>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">Another possibility is to evaluate the process. Consider three possible approaches. The first is the <span style="font-style: italic;">market theory</span>: a fair settlement is whatever the parties agree to, provided that the agreement has not resulted from coercion or fraud. The second is the <span style="font-style: italic;">shadow verdict theory</span>: a fair settlement is whatever approximates the result the court would have reached if the case had gone to adjudication—the so-called “shadow verdict.” A final approach is <span style="font-style: italic;">perceptions of fairness</span>: an equitable settlement is what emerges from a process that participants consider just. Major factors that influence those perceptions include whether the parties had an adequate opportunity for their concerns to be heard and whether they were treated with dignity and respect.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1577" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1577" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Which of these approaches should legal rules and legal ethics seek to promote?

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> Almost all settlement agreements in civil sexual misconduct cases include these nondisclosure provisions, which require violators to return or forfeit any payments and to pay their adversaries’ legal fees.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 4.1, titled “Truthfulness in Statements to Others,” prohibits a lawyer from making a false statement of “material fact or law to a third person,” and it also prohibits a lawyer from failing to disclose a material fact when disclosure is necessary to “avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6” governing confidentiality.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 4.1’s prohibitions raise three important issues. First, what is a “material fact”? Second, when is a material fact’s disclosure necessary to “avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act”? Third, when is a disclosure that might otherwise be required under Rule 4.1 nonetheless prohibited because of Rule 1.6? Recall that Rule 1.6(a) prohibits the disclosure without client consent of all “information relating to the representation,” though Rule 1.6(b) permits the lawyer’s discretionary disclosure of confidential information in specific, carefully delineated situations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As to whether a statement is a “material fact,” Comment 2 to Rule 4.1 provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />This Rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation, certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact. Estimates of price or value placed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page724" class="pagebreak" title="724">724</span>on the subject of a transaction and a party’s intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a claim are ordinarily in this category, and so is the existence of an undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal would constitute fraud. Lawyers should be mindful of their obligations under applicable law to avoid criminal and tortious misrepresentation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Likewise, <a id="dabmci_943b57d25cc24e3cbb8e3793a8a6a603" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Op. 06–439 (2006) distinguishes between impermissible misstatements of fact and acceptable “posturing” or “puffing,” such as exaggerated claims about the strength and weakness of factual and legal positions. The opinion further advises:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[S]tatements regarding a party’s negotiating goals or its willingness to compromise . . . as well as statements that can fairly be considered as negotiation “puffing,” ordinarily are not considered false statements of material fact within the meaning of the Rules.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1586" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1586" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Even with that guidance, however, it is still not entirely clear exactly what statements constitute false “material facts.” Are gross exaggerations material facts? What about half-truths or intentional misstatements? What about misrepresentations involving the nature and value of property, the consequences of certain decisions, or the parties’ readiness for trial?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1587" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1587" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Next, recall that Rule 4.1(a) prohibits making “false statement[s] of material fact . . . to a third person,” while 4.1(b) requires disclosure of material facts if “necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client.” This, in turn, requires the lawyer to determine whether keeping particular information secret would constitute a crime or fraud—typically, “misrepresentation”—under relevant state contract or tort law. This determination can be challenging, given the murkiness of doctrine surrounding the fringes of fraud. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Suppose that in the course of negotiations it becomes apparent that your opposing counsel lacks certain crucial information. Your obligations depend partly on the doctrine of fraud. Under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span>, misrepresentations may rise to the level of fraud when they are made to induce consent to a contract, and the maker knows they are false, or lacks confidence in, or knowledge of, their truthfulness.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1588" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1588" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span> In addition—and crucially—<span style="font-style: italic;">nondisclosure</span> may be considered fraudulent in certain circumstances.

First, nondisclosure might be a fraudulent misrepresentation if it permits some <span style="font-style: italic;">previous</span> false, material statement to stand uncorrected.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1589" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1589" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> Second, nondisclosure might be considered fraudulent if the fact in question concerns a basic assumption of the negotiation, and nondisclosure would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page725" class="pagebreak" title="725">725</span>violate “good faith and . . . reasonable standards of fair dealing.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1590" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1590" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span> Relevant factors include whether the negotiator deliberately attempted to deceive, was dealing with an unusually gullible party, made partial disclosures that were literally true but misleading, had material information unavailable to the other side, or reasonably appeared to have special skill and judgment related to the matter in question.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1591" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1591" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span> Finally, a person’s non-disclosure may be equivalent to an affirmative misrepresentation “where the other person is entitled to know the fact because of a relation of trust and confidence between them.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1592" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1592" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Second) of Torts</span> also provides that a misrepresentation may be fraudulent when the maker knows of its falsity or lacks confidence in its truth.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1593" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1593" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> The <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement </span>also<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>specifies several situations in which <span style="font-style: italic;">nondisclosure</span> is equivalent to misrepresentation. They include circumstances where the negotiator owes fiduciary duties to the other party; where the negotiator knows that disclosure is necessary to prevent statements from being otherwise misleading; or where the negotiator knows that the other party is mistaken as to an undisclosed fact that is basic to the transaction and the negotiator “because of the relationship [with the other party], the customs of the trade or other objective circumstances, would reasonably expect a disclosure.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1594" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1594" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span> The <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> also imposes a duty to “to exercise reasonable care to disclose” accurate information “before the transaction is consummated” if (1) false information was previously conveyed with no “expectation that it would be acted upon,” and (2) the negotiator “subsequently learns” that his counterparty is “about to act in reliance upon” that false information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1595" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1595" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> These rules suggest that a negotiator may engage in puffing only so long as those on the other side don’t indicate that they take it too seriously.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The third question that sometimes arises is: What should lawyers do when disclosure requirements conflict with obligations of client confidentiality? Recall that Rule 4.1(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.1(b)&quot; " /> requires disclosure of material facts “when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client,<span style="font-style: italic;"> unless</span> disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6&quot; " />.” (Italics added). The “unless” clause imposes a major limitation because Rule 1.6(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(a)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(a)&quot; \c 16 " /> forbids a lawyer from revealing confidential information without client consent, except if the disclosure is “impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation.” The Comment to this Rule indicates that a lawyer is impliedly authorized to make a disclosure in negotiation “that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion,” but <span style="font-style: italic;">only if</span> the client’s instructions do not limit that authority. If a client instructs the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page726" class="pagebreak" title="726">726</span>lawyer to keep certain information secret, Rules 1.6 and 4.1(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.1(b)&quot; " /> together seem to require confidentiality.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, as Chapter 6 notes, Rule 1.6(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)&quot; " /> permits the disclosure of confidences in specified circumstances. Rule 1.6(b)(2)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)(2)&quot; " />, for instance, allows a lawyer to reveal client confidences “to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyer’s services.” Rule 1.6(b)(3)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(3)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(3)&quot; \c 16 " /> permits disclosure “to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another” that has already occurred or is reasonably certain to occur because of client misconduct, “in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer’s services.” In addition, pursuant to Rule 1.6(b)(6)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)(6)&quot; " />, a lawyer may disclose confidences “to comply with other law or a court order.” This exception arguably permits a lawyer to disclose confidences so long as she is doing so to avoid misrepresentation, which would count as compliance with “other law.” Whether the law of misrepresentation does or should trump the law of confidentiality in this way is, however, a question on which there is no clear agreement. The Comment to Rule 1.6 ducks it altogether, stating that whether any other law “supersedes Rule 1.6 is a question of law beyond the scope of these rules.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When disclosure is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> permissible under confidentiality rules, the Comment to Rule 1.6 makes clear that lawyers must withdraw from representation instead of allowing their services to be used to further a fraud. Rule 8.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(c)&quot; " /> similarly provides that: “[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.” Faced with a choice whether to have a lawyer withdraw midway through negotiations or to disclose material information, many clients will prefer disclosure, particularly if failure to do so could later void the transaction. </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">One final issue involving candor in settlement negotiations involves whether lawyers must correct statements made in depositions, or in discovery responses, when the lawyer learns the testimony or statement is untrue after-the-fact. <a id="dabmci_906a18c783204a9baf2e30959482bc7d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 30(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, if requested by either the deponent or a party to the litigation, a deponent has “30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which . . . to review the transcript or recording,” and, “if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.” <span style="color: #000000;">According to one respected treatise, one issue that is </span>“hotly <span style="color: #000000;">contested” </span><span style="color: #000000;">is whether this rule permits the deponent actually to change his or her testimony or whether it merely allows the deponent to </span><span style="color: #000000;" class="coconcept3443">correct</span><span style="color: #000000;"> typographical errors.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1596" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1596" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> Some federal courts allow the deponent to make </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page727" class="pagebreak" title="727">727</span><span style="color: #000000;">significant changes; other courts, by contrast, permit only insubstantial alterations.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1597" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1597" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In negotiations over a hotel’s breach of contract to host an organization’s conference, the attorney for the defendant hotel makes an initial settlement offer of $150,000. The lawyer for the plaintiff organization maintains that his client’s officers would never accept such an offer, that damages from the breach are likely to be much higher, and that any jury award would be more substantial. The lawyer actually believes that if the case went to trial, his client would receive a substantially smaller sum. Based on that advice, the plaintiff’s president has authorized the lawyer to settle for any amount over $100,000.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In responding to the initial offer, the plaintiff’s lawyer also represents that it would be impossible for his client to find another suitable hotel under such short notice, a statement that the plaintiff made at his deposition. When the lawyer later contacts his client to report the settlement offer, he learns that another hotel has orally agreed to host the conference, and that the agreement preceded the deposition. When he then calls the defendant’s attorney to accept the settlement, the attorney opens the conversation by asking: “How are efforts to mitigate the damages coming along?” The plaintiff’s lawyer responds: “Nothing definite yet.” The settlement is then finalized at $150,000.</p>

When reviewing the wife’s proposed settlement, the husband’s lawyer notices a $100,000 calculation error by opposing counsel that understates the wife’s alleged interest in jointly owned real estate. The lawyer brings the matter to the attention of his client, who believes that the understated figure is a more accurate reflection of the property’s true worth. Accordingly, the lawyer prepares a counteroffer replicating the error in a way that minimizes the likelihood of its discovery. On the mistaken belief that the husband has surrendered his challenge to the value of the real estate, the wife abandons her challenge to the value and ownership of the stock. Both parties ultimately accept a version of the husband’s counteroffer and sign a final agreement that recites the disposition of assets without specifying their value.</p>

The attorney further suggests that she should avoid looking doubtful in front of the judge, who must approve the agreement.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1598" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1598" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span></p>

      <p style="margin-right: 21.6pt; text-align: right;" class="TextFlush">—Montaigne</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Law professor Charles Craver, who teaches courses and workshops on legal negotiation and settlement, likes to begin by saying, “I’ve never <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page729" class="pagebreak" title="729">729</span>been involved in legal negotiations where both sides didn’t lie.” It tends to get some “shocked responses,” he admits.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Craver, a former litigator and labor law practitioner, does not stop there. He goes on to defend some lies in the course of settlement talks as perfectly proper.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil, on the other hand, lying is anathema, and nothing about the settlement setting excuses it. “My opinion is, no lying,” he says, adding, somewhat wryly, “Strike one blow for naiveté.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Whether naive or not, Brazil does seem to be in a minority. Not all lawyers are as unapologetic as Craver, but interviews with experts who have focused on negotiation and ethics, plus several litigators and judicial officers, indicate that most believe lying in settlement talks is not always prohibited (and that volunteering the truth is not always required).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the 15 interviews, <span style="font-style: italic;">Inside Litigation</span> asked what a lawyer ought to do in each of four hypothetical settlement situations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Participants included nine law professors who have written on ethics, negotiation, or both; five experienced litigators, a federal circuit court judge, and a U.S. magistrate. . . . Most specified what they believed prevailing ethics rules would allow. A few answered in terms of what they would do but did not venture opinions on the formal ethics rules. In several instances, some noted that ethics rules might permit lying but that, personally, they would not do it. The lawyers also volunteered suggestions on tactics . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Situation No. 1: Lying About Authorized Limits</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Your clients, the defendants, have told you that you are authorized to pay $750,000 to settle the case. In settlement negotiations, after your offer of $650,000, the plaintiffs’ attorney asks, “Are you authorized to settle for $750,000?” Can you say, “No, I’m not?”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">(Two of the litigators well-known for representing plaintiffs were asked essentially the same question with the roles reversed, so that the plaintiffs’ attorney is asked whether he or she is authorized to settle for a specific amount.)</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of those willing to give a straight yes or no answer, six say no, you cannot say that. Seven say yes, you can—but all but one of these add that as a matter either of personal ethics or strategy, they would not give such an answer.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“Outright lying always is out of bounds,” according to David Luban. . . . It’s not that one can never be misleading in the admittedly adversarial game of negotiation, he explains. But the way the process works, when one side makes an evasive statement, the other side can ask a question to clarify that position. A flat, declarative statement sends no signal that clarification is needed. “People have to be able to rely on flat-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page730" class="pagebreak" title="730">730</span>out declarations,” Luban says, or the process breaks down or, at best, becomes “incredibly time-consuming.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Geoffrey Hazard Jr., the author of the ABA Model Rules, agrees that “you’re allowed to make an evasive statement.” He too says that an outright lie in Situation No. 1 would violate Rule 4.1. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Litigator Jacob Stein, however, argues that this is one of those statements, referred to in the comment to Rule 4.1, that “ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact.” If the opponent says he or she is not authorized to pay more, “I don’t rely on that,” says Stein. “In the realm of negotiation, the issue is whether there’s reliance.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Several participants contend that the ethics rules would permit the lie but their personal standards would not. Stein is in this camp. So is James White of the University of Michigan. “A flat denial of that sort”—although permissible—“makes me uncomfortable. It’s questionable morally,” White says. In the view of Judge Alvin Rubin, a representation about settlement authority should not be considered a representation of fact under the ethics rules. But he, too, says, “Personally, I would avoid the question rather than answer untruthfully.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Craver, on the other hand, not only believes that lying is permissible in Situation No. 1 but says, “I don’t have any hesitancy in lying about my authorized limits”; he has done it before and would do it again, he says. Lying is an acceptable response to the inquiry, in his view, because “the other side has no right to that information.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most of those interviewed point out that a negotiator who is asked about authorized settlement limits can dodge the question or deflect it in a variety of ways. “The way to avoid [the problem] is to think ahead and have answers ready,” says White. He recalls, for example, negotiators who would simply laugh and say, “You don’t think I’m going to tell you answers to questions like that.” Or the negotiator can answer the question with a question, White adds: When the plaintiff’s lawyer asks, “Are you authorized to settle for $750,000,” the defendant’s lawyer asks, “Are you willing to come below $750,000?” According to Craver, treating the question as an offer sometimes can be an effective strategy: “I appreciate your movement; it’s in the right direction, but $750,000 is still too much.” Ronald Rotunda of the University of Illinois suggests responding, “I’ll bring back to my client the best offer I can get.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The interviewees agree that whatever response the lawyer chooses, consistency is important. If you refuse to answer questions about authorized limits in the course of the settlement talks, you must always refuse, or the exception will be obvious to the opponent.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A no-lying rule, Craver complains, means that the negotiator would always have to swear off the “limited authority” technique—a Mutt-and-Jeff kind of approach that casts the negotiator as a nice guy whose flexibility is limited by a tough-minded client. “The negotiator could never say, ‘I’m sorry, I’m just not authorized . . . ,’ even when the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page731" class="pagebreak" title="731">731</span>statement is true, because he or she would be forced to tell the truth—and cut off a possible better deal for the client—when the opponent probes further and hits on the actual authorized figure. Yet, ‘limited authority’ is a very, very common technique,” Craver says. And saying, “No, I’m not authorized,” he notes, is much more forceful than saying, “You know you can’t ask me that.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Some experienced practitioners, however, eschew that technique anyway. For one thing, they say, it would imply a lack of influence with the client that the opponent would not find credible. Says plaintiffs’ lawyer Leonard Ring, “I don’t use the word authorize. I have a lot of persuasion with my client.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">(Invoking limited authority—at the $750,000 level, for example—can pose a slight practical problem if $750,000 turns out to be the best figure you can get, and you want to settle. You then have to discover, in a phone call, perhaps, that your client has been “persuaded after all.” Whether you actually phone the client or call your spouse to discuss grocery shopping, as far as Craver is concerned, does not raise an ethical issue. “I would have no qualms lying about the phone call,” he says.)</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Situation No. 2: Lying About an Injury</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">You represent a plaintiff who claims to have suffered a serious knee injury. In settlement negotiations, can you say your client is “disabled” when you know she is out skiing?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The score: no, fourteen; yes, one. This question was the only one of the four that yielded a solid consensus. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Situation No. 3: Exaggerating an Injury</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">You are trying to negotiate a settlement on behalf of a couple who charge that the bank pulled their loan, ruining their business. Your clients are quite upbeat and deny suffering particularly severe emotional distress. Can you tell your opponent, nonetheless, that they did?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The score: no, eight; yes, five (with two not answering directly).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Brazil says no. “Lawyers should try to get for clients what they need, and not more,” he argues. “Measuring our value as lawyers by how much we get for the client,” he adds, is an “insidious trend” and a “source of great ethical strain on the system.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Some see No. 3 as a closer question but believe that pushing the emotional distress element in settlement talks would be an unacceptable misrepresentation of fact. Says Rubin, “It moves closer to the permissible [than No. 2] but does not yet reach it.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But several lawyers who find the assertion of disability in No. 2 to be unethical do not object to the assertion of emotional distress in No. 3. Obviously, some distress has occurred—“if they didn’t care at all, there wouldn’t be a legal matter,” says Craver. “I’m embellishing the concern.” White agrees that exaggeration of the degree of pain experienced by a client is “well within the range of puffing.” The fundamental question, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page732" class="pagebreak" title="732">732</span>says White, is “what are your and my legitimate expectations [as opposing negotiators]?” The opponent expects exaggeration of pain, White believes.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Explaining further, White draws an analogy to sales law, which distinguishes between puffing and making a warranty by asking whether reliance on the statement would be reasonable. In this analogy, lawyers are sophisticated buyers and sellers: the defense lawyer is a buyer, the plaintiff’s lawyer, a seller. “Because they’re sophisticated, a fair amount of puffing is permitted without it being a warranty,” White says. “It’s like two car dealers” negotiating the sale and purchase of a car. (Independently, Rotunda arrives at a similar analogy but draws a different conclusion. Contending that the exaggeration in Situation No. 3 is improper, Rotunda observes, “If lawyers want to be like used car salesmen, this is a good place to start.”) . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rex Perschbacher of the University of California agrees that reasonableness of reliance is one criterion—working in combination, he believes, with the degree of specificity. That is, as questions become more specific, the negotiator has less freedom to lie because the opponent’s reliance on the answer becomes more reasonable. Thus, Perschbacher says no to No. 1 and no to No. 2, but would allow the claim for emotional distress in No. 3.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Several who say the lawyer in No. 3 cannot make an outright assertion about emotional distress do acknowledge that the issue can be raised in a more oblique way. Hazard, for example, would let the negotiator say that cutting off a loan is the <span style="font-style: italic;">kind of act</span> that can produce serious distress. “You can suggest that the other party ought to think about it, with a carefully chosen phrase,” says Hazard. Or you can ask a rhetorical question, says Luban: “Wouldn’t <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> feel as though the world has caved in on you?”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Stein, who says no to No. 3, adds that the assertion of emotional distress in that situation would be unwise. “A good negotiator would ask for medical reports, and you wouldn’t have any,” he says. McNamara, too, questions the effectiveness of exaggeration. “Stick to the facts,” he advises. “Somewhere or other there are pieces of paper that make it clear what the facts are.” Surely, he says, you can point out that “one of the items the jury can consider is not just the plaintiffs’ loss but the effect on these people.” And that, he says, “is exactly how far I’d take it. . . . You don’t want to hurt the client’s case . . . by losing credibility as an advocate.”</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Situation No. 4: A Mistaken Impression</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">In settlement talks over the couple’s lender liability case, your opponent’s comments make it clear that he thinks the plaintiffs have gone out of business, although you didn’t say that. In fact, the business is continuing, and several important contracts are in the offing. You are on </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page733" class="pagebreak" title="733">733</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">the verge of settlement; can you go ahead and settle without correcting your opponent’s misimpression?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The score: no, four; yes, nine (with two not answering directly).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The participants agree that you cannot say anything to further or ratify the misimpression. But beyond that point, disagreement sets in.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Hazard says no on the ground that the ethics rules incorporate the law of fraud—“and the law of fraud,” adds Hazard, “is more exacting than most lawyers think.” The opponent’s belief that the client is out of business is “a manifest misapprehension that goes to the bargain itself,” Hazard says. McNamara, too, says, “It does not pass the smell test with me. . . . [In this situation], failure to speak up is fraud.” But White disagrees with this conclusion, referring again to the bargaining between two car dealers—there is no obligation under the common law of fraud to correct the savvy dealer’s error, White says.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Interestingly, Craver, outspoken in his support for lying in Situation No. 1, finds No. 4 so difficult a situation that he cannot give a definite answer. If he thought that correcting the misimpression would not hurt the client, he says, he would do it. But if it looked like the settlement would fall apart on that issue alone, he’s not so sure. By contrast, Luban—who flatly says no to the outright lie in No. 1—generally approves keeping quiet in No. 4.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The difference for Luban lies in his rule that flat-out declarations have to be true—No. 4, obviously, involves no such declaration. “It’s not my job to do their job for them,” Luban says of the opponent in No. 4, “as long as my word isn’t on the line.” Similarly, says plaintiffs’ lawyer David Shrager, “I’m not in litigation to educate the opponent.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Several interviewees who say the misimpression need not be corrected add that there are factors that could tip the answer [the] other way. Perschbacher would want to consider whether circumstances beyond those stated in the hypothetical, give rise to a claim that the opponent is placing particular reliance on the negotiator who keeps quiet. For example, Perschbacher says, if the misimpression relates to a fact that the opponent cannot determine on his own, then failure to correct his misimpression might be improper. Luban agrees, and adds that the consequences for the opponent probably should be weighed in as well.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Luban cites a Minnesota Supreme Court case from 1962 to show what he means about consequences. In <a id="dabmci_c08c5fdc567940bbbc8ef32340c87e23" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Spaulding v. Zimmerman&quot; \s &quot;A;E;22;dabmci_c08c5fdc567940bbbc8ef32340c87e23_1;I4818fce0fe5611d9b386b232635db992;;0;S;Spaulding v. Zimmerman, 116 N.W.2d 704 (Minn. 1962)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Spaulding v. Zimmerman</span>, 116 N.W.2d 704 (Minn. 1962), a car crash had led to a personal injury suit. The defense doctor examined the plaintiff and discovered a potentially fatal medical problem that neither the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s lawyer, nor the plaintiff’s doctor knew about. The defense doctor revealed his finding to the defendant’s lawyer, who settled the case without mentioning that the plaintiff could drop dead any second (presumably, that fact would have affected the settlement value adversely from the defense point of view). The defendant’s lawyer was not responsible for the plaintiff’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page734" class="pagebreak" title="734">734</span>misimpression about the value of the case. “But it’s perfectly clear that any lawyer with a grain of conscience would tell the plaintiff he had to see a doctor. You don’t let somebody drop dead to save your client some money,” Luban says. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In <a id="dabmci_25bee1f49e2d423eaa59e8920519dabc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Spaulding v. Zimmerman</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> the Minnesota court did not say the defendant’s lawyer had acted unethically, but it did void the settlement, as the plaintiff had asked it to do. As a practical matter, that points to a problem with keeping quiet in Situation No. 4, as several interviewees emphasize—if an attack on the settlement ensues once the opponent learns the facts, your client might not have the peace he thought he was buying. “That’s one practical reason for taking the ethical high road,” says Brazil. But Stein, who says that correction of the misimpression is not required, believes that a well-crafted release would probably foreclose an attack on the settlement. . . . Not surprisingly, given the range of reactions to the hypotheticals, experts approach the issue of truth in the settlement process from a variety of perspectives. “I don’t see why the law should allow attorneys to tell a bald-faced lie,” says Rotunda. As he sees it, the comments to Rule 4.1, which forgive certain lies because of “generally accepted conventions in negotiation,” are an attempt to “slice the baloney [too] thin.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Others attach more weight to the dynamics of the negotiation process. “I can’t expect the opponent to reveal all his information to me,” says White. “It’s appropriate for him to try to get me to believe some things that are not true.” Negotiation, according to McNamara, becomes “orderly capitulation” unless the negotiator misrepresents to some degree.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Hazard describes negotiation as a process of “communicating without giving away the store.” The communication occurs through the exchange of incomplete signals; it “necessarily entails an exploratory process” and “a certain amount of acting,” Hazard says.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the same time, countervailing forces exist—and not just moral or religious ones—in favor of candor. One such force is reputation. Legal practice would be cumbersome indeed if other lawyers were never willing to take you at your word, Craver notes. “There has to be a level of candor if one is going to practice law,” he says. Moreover, he observes, candor can be a good tactic. In this regard, he says a possible approach to Situation No. 4 would be to correct the misimpression and build on the boost in credibility with the opponent that such a step would bring.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">McNamara has another reason to tell the truth—he knows he would not be a good liar. “I can’t be my most convincing when I’m lying,” he says.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you respond to the hypothetical situations in Lempert’s article? Do any of these examples involve misrepresentations within the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page735" class="pagebreak" title="735">735</span>meaning of Rule 4.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.1&quot; " />? If, under this Rule, statements about settlement authority are “ordinarily” not viewed as statements of fact, what is meant by “ordinarily”? Consider ABA Ethical Guideline § 4.1.1, Committee Notes, which identify factors relevant to whether a statement should be considered one of fact, such as the parties’ past relationship, the opponent’s apparent sophistication, the phrasing of the statement, and the negotiating practices of the community. A California Bar Ethics Opinion concluded that the statement “Plaintiff needs $375,000 if you want to settle this case,” when the actual bottom line number is $175,000, constituted “allowable ‘puffery’ rather than a misrepresentation of fact.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1599" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1599" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Why are misrepresentations about settlement authority or related matters justifiable? As the examples from the excerpt above suggest, experienced practitioners often sidestep direct inquiries on these issues with responses such as “I’m not free to disclose that” or “I would advise my client that the case justifies $20,000.” Would it be preferable to require that lawyers avoid direct misstatements of their clients’ willingness to accept certain settlements?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Two subsequent studies replicated Lempert’s questions. They found that most practitioners followed the <a id="dabmci_54537312491f4287926692503f2ab61d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Opinion 06–439, which suggests that a lawyer can deflect questions about settlement authority but cannot lie if directly asked.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1600" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1600" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What about other forms of bluffing, such as false claims by a buyer that he has seen a better price in a discount catalogue, or by a seller that she has another buyer willing to pay the full asking price?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1601" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1601" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> What about false claims about the defendant’s insurance policy limit, or plans to file for bankruptcy in the absence of a defense verdict?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1602" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1602" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> Those who argue that such misrepresentations are harmless generally assume that the opposing party will recognize bluffing or “puffing” for what it is. But if that were always true, the practice would also be ineffective. Bluffing and puffing continue because sometimes they work, and some opponents are deceived. To some commentators, parties dealing with a lawyer should not need to exercise the same degree of caution as they would if trading at a bazaar.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1603" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1603" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> What is your view? How much prudence is it reasonable to expect concerning such statements?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page736" class="pagebreak" title="736">736</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Game theorist Thomas Schelling writes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">A bargain is struck when somebody makes a final, sufficient concession. Why does he concede? Because he thinks the other will not. “I must concede because he won’t. He won’t because he thinks I will. He thinks I will because he thinks I think he thinks so. . . .” There is some range of alternative outcomes in which any point is better for both sides than no agreement at all. To insist on any such point is pure bargaining, since one always <span style="font-style: italic;">would</span> take less rather than reach no agreement at all, and since one always <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> recede if retreat proves necessary to agreement. Yet if both parties are aware of the limits to this range, <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> outcome is a point from which at least one party would have been willing to retreat and the other knows it! There is no resting place.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1604" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1604" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If Schelling is correct, it will be difficult for negotiators to reach agreement unless they have managed to keep their bottom lines hidden from each other. Total candor becomes an obstacle to agreement, even when both sides want to agree. From this perspective, negotiation is like the game of chicken. It ends when one side has successfully bluffed the other, and bluffing is impossible if either party knows his opponent’s settlement point. What does this analysis suggest about obligations of candor and disclosure on the part of negotiators? Under what circumstances would full disclosure of relevant facts assist or impede the negotiation process? What interpretation of existing rules would best serve societal interests?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is it unethical for a negotiator to make representations that are highly misleading, even though they are not literally false? How would you assess the conduct of the plaintiff’s lawyer in Problem 1(a)?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The case on which Problem 1(a) is based arose during the 1960s, when the Washington, D.C. Mattachine Society planned what it billed as the first national conference to focus on gay and lesbian rights. The Manger Hotel agreed to host the conference with knowledge of its subject. Then, two weeks before the event, after invitations had been mailed, management in the hotel chain’s home office ordered cancellation of the agreement. Monroe Freedman, the Society’s lawyer, later defended his conduct:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Was anything definite about mitigation at that point? Is anything ever definite in this life? After all, the Mattachine Society had thought that the deal with the Manger was definite, and it turned out that it wasn’t. . . . The statement about mitigation wasn’t a flat-out denial: it was equivocal—an evasion that a careful listener could have picked up on. “What do you mean ‘nothing definite’?” he might have said<span style="font-style: italic;">. . . .</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1605" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1605" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">According to Freedman, the new offer of a hotel site was confidential information and, as long as he did not make a false statement of material fact, he did not need to disclose it under Rule 4.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.1&quot; " />. Do you find his reasoning persuasive? What would you have done if you had been in Freedman’s shoes?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />On the facts of Problem 1(c) about the lease negotiations, the New Jersey court held that the lessee’s lawyer may have committed malpractice, and that the lessor’s lawyer may be liable as well. Under the court’s analysis, an attorney has a duty not only to represent a client “effectively and vigorously” but also to “act fairly and in good faith.” At a minimum, the lawyer had an obligation to counsel his client to disclose the impending foreclosure and, if the client refused, to withdraw from representation under Rule 1.16. In the court’s view, the lawyer was in a “difficult position,” but “the practice of law is not easy.” <a id="dabmci_5a9db9633f9049cdadc5324aaf5373ef" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Davin v.

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The mistake might never have come to light had not the husband desired to have the exquisite last word. A few days after [the wife] had obtained the divorce he mailed her a copy of the offer which contained the errant computation. On top of the page he wrote with evident satisfaction: “PLEASE NOTE $100,000.00 MISTAKE IN YOUR FIGURES. . . .” The present action was filed exactly one month later.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The court reformed the agreement under <a id="dabmci_456cb6f0595b4683b529d34074a87e73" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 3399 of the California Civil Code to conform to the wife’s understanding. The Code provides:</p>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What would you have done as counsel for the husband?

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Must lawyers seek their clients’ approval before correcting a scrivener’s error?

In the Committee’s view, the lawyer should contact opposing counsel to correct the error and had no obligation to obtain the client’s permission. Rule 1.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(a)&quot; " /> provides that lawyers “shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and . . . shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.” The Comment to the Rule acknowledges the lawyer’s responsibility for technical and strategic issues. Rule 1.4 requires lawyers to explain matters “reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.” Under the Committee’s analysis, once the client had accepted the disputed provision, no informed decision remained to be made. In addition, the Committee relied on general prohibitions on conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, contained in Rule 8.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(c)&quot; " /> and the provision in Rule 4.1(b) that lawyers shall not fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a fraudulent act by a client unless the information is privileged. <span style="font-style: italic;">Accord</span> ABA Ethical Guideline § 4.3.5 (providing that it is unprofessional for a lawyer to knowingly exploit a drafting error). Do you agree with the Committee’s analysis? Does it follow that a knowing <span style="font-style: italic;">failure</span> to disclose an error would constitute fraud and provide grounds for discipline?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Suppose that in Problem 1(d) the attorney had not noticed the scrivener’s error until the husband showed him the letter about to be sent to the wife. How should the attorney have responded?

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How should lawyers deal with unrepresented, unsophisticated adversaries? Is it enough for lawyers in cases like 1(e) to comply with Rule 4.3, which requires them to avoid implying that they are disinterested; to correct misunderstandings concerning their role; and to refrain from giving legal advice when the lawyer “knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such a person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of the client”? </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">These cases raise the following questions: Should the same standards apply in negotiations and in adversary proceedings?

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">12.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should negotiators who are acting as agents for others have some duty to protect themselves from deceptive nondisclosures? Research on negotiation ethics suggests that a range of factors influence the likelihood of deception, including personal characteristics, situational incentives, and the relationship between the parties. In general, parties are more willing to deceive by omission than commission, so prudent negotiators will ask as many specific questions as possible, particularly in circumstances in which they have no ongoing relationship.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1611" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1611" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">13.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As the discussion has underscored, the bargaining process involves ethical as well as legal considerations. In this, as in other contexts, the law and morality of lawyering are not necessarily coextensive. Legal doctrine and bar disciplinary rules often establish only minimal requirements due to the costs of enforcement, the problems of proof, the need for stability in transactions, and the consequences of widespread noncompliance. Accordingly, legal requirements do not exhaust the ethical considerations that are relevant in shaping negotiation behavior. Lawyers also have an individual interest in maintaining their own reputations and a shared interest in supporting standards of good faith and fair dealing on which any efficient bargaining process depends. The world of legal practice, like society more generally, relies on a “background of trust that makes sharp practices conspicuous and jarring,” as well as counterproductive in any context involving ongoing relationships.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1612" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1612" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The late federal Judge Alvin Rubin puts the point directly:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">It is inherent in the concept of professionalism that the profession will regulate itself, adhering to an ethos that imposes standards higher than mere law observance. Client avarice and hostility neither control the lawyer’s conscience nor measure his ethics. Surely if its practitioners are principled, a profession that dominates the legal process in our law-oriented society would not expect too much if it required its members to adhere to two simple principles when they negotiate as professionals: Negotiate honestly and in good faith; and do not take unfair advantage of another, regardless of his relative expertise or sophistication.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1613" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1613" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">14.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many attorneys seem to ignore Judge Rubin’s principles. In one study, some 730 lawyers were given a hypothetical in which their client was suing a former girlfriend for sexual transmission of a deadly disease. Although the client had tested positive for the disease, he later learned that the test was false and that he was healthy. Subsequently, the client asks his lawyer not to reveal that fact in pre-litigation settlement discussion. Almost one-fifth of the lawyers (19 percent) would agree to the client’s request and another 19 percent were unsure. As the authors note, nondisclosure under these circumstances would generally constitute fraud.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1614" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1614" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span> If you had been the man’s lawyer, would you have agreed to his request? Why or why not?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">15.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Law professor Donald Langevoort offers an economic justification for treating “half-truths” as deceptive:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Why do we have law barring affirmative misrepresentations in the first place? Why don’t we say that reasonable people should always do their own “due diligence” investigation rather than rely on information provided by someone with an obviously conflicting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page741" class="pagebreak" title="741">741</span>interest? . . . [T]he orthodox answer is that the law of fraud is efficient. It allows the less informed party to forego the costly and duplicative process of factual investigation and information discovery, thereby reducing transaction costs. The law offers a credibility bond for the reliability of factual representations by the informed party.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">It is not at all hard to extend this same logic to the half-truth. That is, it facilitates efficient transacting to say that the law will offer a credibility bond when a person speaks not only for the technical accuracy of the statement but also its natural and normal implication as a matter of ordinary communication (putting aside any expectations created by law). Language is inherently imprecise; it is not functional to force people to stop and analyze statements to see if there is some subtle limit or ambiguity that must be clarified. . . . A certain level of protection for reasonable inferences is thus appropriate. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">This strikes me as a helpful approach, but I want to consider a significant refinement. . . . [T]here are some contexts [such as the hearing in <a id="dabmci_c31d118867c244a195b1958eca9049e2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Bronston v. United States</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>] in which the half-truth doctrine has little necessary place. If there is in fact little or no trust between two parties—a truly adversarial setting—it is difficult to justify the doctrine at all. At least ex <a id="dabmci_6c6db4942c1941deafe90b3cc2e0cb78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ante, I suspect that in these settings parties will often prefer a default rule of mere technical accuracy, with its reduced risk of ex post litigation. While I have seen no explicit statement in the case law that the half-truth doctrine adjusts downward to reflect a lack of trust between the parties, it should.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Conversely, we should expect that negotiations characterized by a high degree of trust should lead to an upward adjustment: a broad half-truth doctrine, one with little privilege to conceal once a matter is addressed at all.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1615" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1615" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">By contrast, Professor Alan Strudler argues that even in some less adversarial business negotiations, half-truths should be permissible. In his view, negotiators who have invested time and effort in acquiring useful information should be able to capitalize on their efforts. Strudler proposes a “deserved advantage principle: other things being equal, the more value one brings to the bargaining table, the more one may fairly insist upon as return.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1616" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1616" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> If, for example, the buyer’s hard work has unearthed information indicating that the seller’s property is worth more than the seller thinks it is, the buyer should not have to disclose the information. Strudler notes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The commercial world teems with . . . intermediaries or middlemen, from jobbers and distributors to stockbrokers and real estate agents. A financial intermediary is a bargain hunter; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page742" class="pagebreak" title="742">742</span>whether searching garage sales for impressionist works of art or inexpensive farm land for mineral deposits, she seeks to buy low and sell high. A bargain hunter’s job involves exploiting a seller’s lack of knowledge.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1617" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1617" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Are Langevoort’s and Strudler’s proposals consistent? If not, which is more convincing? Consider negotiating experts’ concern that reinforcing an ethic of non-disclosure will lead too many negotiators to lose credibility and miss opportunities for mutually advantageous agreements. Richard Shell argues instead for “information-based bargaining” in which negotiators try to get as much reliable knowledge about the situation and other party as possible. That will enable participants to “think outside the box” and to devise agreements that fall within a “zone of overlap” of parties’ settlement points.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1618" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1618" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">A form of dispute resolution that has become increasingly popular over the last two decades is mediation. As defined by Standard I of the ABA’s Model Standards of Practice for Family and Divorce Mediation (2001), mediation is a process that “relies upon the ability of participants to make their own voluntary and informed decisions.” In this process, the primary role of a mediator is “to assist the participants to gain a better understanding of their own needs and the needs and interests of others and to facilitate agreement among the participants.” Mediation serves a different function than arbitration, in which a neutral third party imposes a resolution. Rather, in the words of Lon Fuller, the “central quality of mediation [is] its capacity to reorient the parties toward each other, not by imposing rules on them, but by helping them to achieve a new and shared perception of their relationship.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1619" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1619" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span> The strengths and limitations of mediation as a form of alternative dispute resolution are explored in Chapter 13. Discussion here focuses on the ethical issues that confront lawyer-mediators.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Mediation generally takes one of three forms. “Facilitative” mediators stress the importance of mediator neutrality and party autonomy. Their goal is to help parties develop their own problem solving capacity.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1620" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1620" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> “Evaluative” mediators believe part of their role is to help parties assess the strengths of their positions and potential settlements, based on law and practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1621" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1621" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span> “Transformative” mediators focus on personal growth and enabling the parties to develop a better recognition <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page743" class="pagebreak" title="743">743</span>of their own goals, values, and capacities, as well as greater empathy for the concerns of others.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1622" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1622" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Mediation can occur to resolve disputes of any sort but is particularly common in the labor, employment, and family law contexts. Family courts often recommend and sometimes require divorcing parties to participate in mediation to work out the details of property and custody settlements. These days, an increasing number of lawyers have become mediators, bringing the ethics of mediation to the fore.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In disputes involving legal issues, lawyer-mediators can promote agreement by helping the parties minimize conflict, understand their rights, explore underlying problems, and draft a legally enforceable agreement. Lawyers can also represent one of the parties during mediation sessions or review agreements afterward. Standard VI of the ABA’s Standards of Practice advises consultation with an attorney before concluding an agreement. But engaging separate attorneys imposes some of the financial costs that mediation is often intended to avoid<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> Moreover, the participation of counsel may compromise parties’ control and autonomy, pushing them into excessively adversarial bargaining positions. Having a lawyer later review a mediated agreement can be equally problematic. An attorney who has not participated in the negotiations, who does not know what facts came out or what logs were rolled, often cannot judge the fairness of the resulting agreement. In determining whether to obtain independent legal advice, parties need to consider whether they are willing to accept the additional expense and risk of unraveling part of a mediated settlement.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861644" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219198" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756600" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908734" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Lawyer’s Role in Mediation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When can a lawyer serve as mediator, and what ethical rules apply? Some state bar ethics committees initially prohibited lawyers from mediating certain types of disputes, such as divorce. Underlying these restrictions were concerns about conflicts of interest and inadequate protection for confidentiality. Other bar committees barred most lawyer-mediators but authorized divorce mediation on the theory that the lawyer represents neither party. A third view, put forth by many experts, was that a lawyer-mediator represents both parties.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1623" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1623" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> The Model Rules take no position on that issue. Rule 2.4(a) only defines the term “third-party neutral,” and subpart (b) requires a lawyer to “explain the difference between the lawyer’s role as a third-party neutral and a lawyer’s role as one who represents a client.” Much rides on this distinction. If a lawyer is jointly representing both parties in mediating their dispute, then that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page744" class="pagebreak" title="744">744</span>lawyer owes duties to both clients, and issues related to the treatment of confidentiality and the waiver of conflicts must be worked out in advance. As a third-party neutral operating under Rule 2.4, a lawyer does not owe specific client duties, but must nonetheless take care to make sure that the parties to the mediation understand the nature of the lawyer’s role and the fact that certain protections, like the attorney-client privilege, do not apply.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In comparing the different bar approaches, most experts view the flat ban on lawyer-mediators in divorce cases as unduly restrictive. In most uncontested divorces, at least one party goes without legal representation. Where parties’ resources are limited, joint access to a single attorney-mediator may be preferable to leaving one spouse unrepresented. Whether mediators are nominally “representing” both or neither party seems less critical than the concrete obligations that the relationship entails, such as requirements of impartiality and informed consent.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219199" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756601" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908735" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Standards Governing Mediation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition to the general guidance offered by the Model Rules, all states have adopted certain standards to govern the mediation process. The ABA, the American Arbitration Association, and the Association for Conflict Resolution have jointly prepared Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators, revised in 2005. The ABA and National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws have also promulgated a Uniform Mediation Act, which has been adopted in some states.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1624" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1624" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Other organizations, meanwhile, have also developed standards for mediation or alternative dispute resolution generally, or standards for particular areas of practice. In 2001, for example, the ABA adopted Model Standards of Practice for Family and Divorce Mediation, which we will discuss below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although these standards differ in some respects, most set forth similar provisions concerning impartiality, conflicts of interest, and confidentiality. For example, the ABA’s Model Standards of Practice for Family and Divorce Mediation, require mediators to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 39.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element90" />explain their role and the process;</li>

        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 39.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element91" />discuss obligations concerning confidentiality and ground rules for any separate sessions with one of the parties;</li>

      </ul>

      </ul>

      </ul>
      <p class="TextFlush">The ABA’s Standards further advise that a lawyer may mediate disputes involving past or present clients, provided that all parties give their informed consent and the lawyer has appropriate qualifications and is able to be impartial. In contexts involving family issues, mediators should have knowledge about the relevant law and the mediation process, as well as the law governing domestic violence and child development, abuse, and neglect.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1626" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1626" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> The parties’ written agreement to mediate a dispute should include provisions regarding fees, and mediators should not make charges contingent on the resolution of the matter.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1627" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1627" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under all of these standards, a mediated negotiation is still a negotiation. Accordingly, it presents many of the same ethical problems such as confidentiality and unequal bargaining power that arise in other bargaining contexts.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861646" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219200" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756602" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908736" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Confidentiality in Mediation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In contexts of joint representation, the attorney-client privilege does not typically apply between the joint clients; nor does it protect disclosures to non-lawyers (unless the non-lawyer is acting as a lawyer’s agent) or to lawyers who do not “represent” either party. Nevertheless, there is a strong sense that what is said in mediations should be confidential. Reflecting this sense, the Uniform Mediation Act, Sections 4 and 5, and many analogous state codes, <span style="font-style: italic;">allow</span> mediators and/or parties to assert a privilege against disclosure except under specified conditions, such as where a person has used mediation to plan, commit, or conceal a crime.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1628" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1628" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Furthermore, <a id="dabmci_d190533c71b84d4f8f3d9dff5af42920" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page746" class="pagebreak" title="746">746</span>state analogues hold that statements made in settlement negotiations, including mediation, are not admissible in subsequent proceedings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1629" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1629" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So, too, virtually all states have enacted some form of confidentiality privilege for mediators. The scope of these protections varies.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1630" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1630" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span> The Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators, Section V, provides that mediators should not disclose any information that parties expect to be confidential without their express permission unless required by law or other public policy. Practices vary when parties’ expectations of privacy conflict with strong societal interests. For example, how should a mediator respond in a land-use proceeding regarding development of a playground if she learns from one of the party’s employees that toxic material is buried underneath the proposed site? Some commentators believe that confidentiality is required if the mediator cannot persuade the party to disclose the problem. Their premise is that people won’t hire a mediator who sees his or her role as protecting the “greater good.” Others believe that the public would be outraged by mediators who allowed a public health disaster to develop under their watch.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1631" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1631" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span> Some states require disclosure in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of child abuse and neglect.

      <p class="TextParagraph">A fundamental question for mediators is how to balance concerns of fairness and impartiality, particularly in light of inequalities in bargaining power. Such inequalities may involve resources, expertise, knowledge, and the ability and willingness to inflict emotional pain. In some instances, as discussed in Subpart 5 below, the power disparities may be so great as to make mediation inappropriate. State codes have adopted differing, sometimes internally inconsistent, standards, and practitioners are divided.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1633" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1633" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On one end of the spectrum are mediators who insist on remaining neutral, however skewed the process or outcome. For example, in labor and commercial contexts, mediators “regularly deal with parties who are of unequal power, and most have no problem with this inequality. For [these] mediators, the primary function is to have the parties come to an agreement.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1634" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1634" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Such neutrality has the advantage of preserving mediators’ credibility and maximizing the chances that participants with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page747" class="pagebreak" title="747">747</span>superior bargaining leverage will agree to mediated solutions. As Christopher Honeyman notes, there are practical constraints on mediators’ abilities to reduce power disparities or to protect unrepresented interests: “If mediators ignored the ‘real world’ and attempted to base all settlements on reason and brotherly love, stronger parties would obtain little benefit from mediation and would soon avoid it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1635" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1635" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum are mediators who intervene in order to balance power and to ensure that the process, as well as the result, meet some minimum standards of fairness. For example, mediators may interrupt intimidating negotiation patterns; meet with the parties separately; structure the bargaining session to equalize participation; provide pre-mediation training to improve participants’ negotiating skills; discuss strategies with each party to address power disparities; or propose that the disadvantaged party seek therapy or separate legal representation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1636" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1636" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Most state codes on mediation ethics make no explicit reference to substantive fairness. Others prescribe withdrawal to avoid outcomes that are “fundamentally unfair” (Georgia) or that are “grossly unjust” (Alabama).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1637" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1637" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">114</a></span> Under Standard XI of the ABA’s Model Standards of Practice for Family and Divorce Mediation, mediators “should consider suspending or terminating the mediation” if . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the participants are about to enter into an agreement that the mediator reasonably believes to be unconscionable;</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a participant is using the mediation process to gain an unfair advantage. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">What constitutes unfairness or unconscionability in a particular case is, however, often open to dispute.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Mediators themselves differ about what might constitute such injustice—and also whether, when considering whether an outcome is appropriate, only the parties’ goals and interests should be considered, or whether broader societal interests should also be addressed. In a celebrated exchange, Lawrence Susskind and Josh Stulberg debated this issue in the context of environmental mediation. Susskind argued that it was not enough to promote balanced participation. Rather, the mediation’s success must also be judged in terms of the fairness and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page748" class="pagebreak" title="748">748</span>stability of agreements that are reached. Further, Susskind insisted that where strong public interests were implicated, environmental mediators should seek to ensure that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> stakeholders are adequately “represented and protected”; that “agreements are as fair and stable as possible; and . . . that agreements reached are interpreted as intended by the community at large and set constructive precedents.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1638" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1638" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span> By contrast, Stulberg argued that nothing in the mediator’s “obligations of office” equips or entitles him to assume the role of “social conscience, environmental policeman or social critic.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1639" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1639" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span> For a mediator to assume responsibility for the fairness of the outcome, Stulberg insisted, is to abandon the neutrality that is essential to their function. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Underlying these issues are more fundamental questions about the meaning of “neutrality.” To some, neutrality requires mediators to prevent their own values from biasing the process. To others, neutrality requires structuring a process that will ensure meaningful participation and promote informed decisionmaking and a reasonable balance of power.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1640" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1640" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span> Model Rule 4.5.6, proposed by the Commission on Ethics and Standards in ADR, attempts to strike a balance. It provides that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The third party neutral should use all reasonable efforts to conduct the process with fairness to all parties. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The third party neutral should make reasonable efforts to prevent misconduct that would invalidate any settlement. The third party neutral should also make reasonable efforts to determine that the parties have reached agreement of their own volition and knowingly consent to any settlement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Comment to the proposed Rule adds:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[2] . . . While some have suggested that third party neutrals should bear some moral accountability or legal responsibility for the agreements they help facilitate, these Rules do not make the third party neutral the guarantor of a fair or just result.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As Chapter 14 indicates, online dispute resolution has grown dramatically over the last two decades, led by sites that handle disputes arising in electronic commerce. The most popular site manages some 60 million disputes a year for eBay users, and e-mediation is the most common form of online ADR.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1641" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1641" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">118</a></span> Most online mediation is facilitative; the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page749" class="pagebreak" title="749">749</span>mediator refrains from expressing opinions or offering solutions, but serves largely as a catalyst. Other mediation is evaluative or a combined approach, in which mediators intervene only if the parties are failing to succeed on their own, and the scope of intervention is determined by the parties themselves.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1642" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1642" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">119</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Compared to in-person mediation, e-mediation holds both advantages and disadvantages. The most obvious benefits are convenience, speed, and cost.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1643" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1643" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span> In addition, proponents claim that electronic dispute resolution offers a “netocracy” that levels the playing field by reducing the tensions, acrimony, and fear-induced concessions that accompany in-person communication among parties with unequal power and unequal tolerance for conflict.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1644" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1644" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span> Forcing parties to communicate in writing also facilitates preservation of exact language and reduces the possibility of ambiguity and selective recall.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1645" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">By contrast, skeptics of e-mediation point out various downsides. Increasing speed is not always an advantage, as it reduces the likelihood of cooling off periods and transformative outcomes. Relying solely on written communication also reduces the emotional cues and possibility for rapport that come with personal contact. For some individuals, online communication encourages aggression.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1646" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1646" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span> Parties may also have different levels of technological competence and comfort, which can create new bargaining inequalities. The ease of distributing digital footprints also pose challenges in ensuring confidentiality.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">E-mediators do, however, have techniques for mitigating some of these problems. They can slow the process down, insist on civility, use private chat rooms to neutralize abuses, propose some face-to-face contact through video-chatting mediums such as Skype, and develop expertise in reading and managing the emotional content of online communication. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A more fundamental problem is that e-mediation, like other forms of online dispute resolution, is virtually unregulated, meaning it does little to ensure that mediators have the aforementioned competencies. There are no shared ethical standards or requirements of training for e-mediators, although some may adhere to voluntary codes or criteria set by online platforms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1647" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1647" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span> The absence of oversight may not be a major concern in some contexts, such as disputes involving e-commerce: There, the stakes are relatively small, there are no third-party interests at stake, and there are some standardized terms and accountability. But in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page750" class="pagebreak" title="750">750</span>other cases, such as divorce, where the long-term well-being of parties and vulnerable children may be implicated and where power imbalances are common and may be significant, a strong case has been made for ethical rules and regulation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1648" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1648" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">With some reservations, you agreed to serve as a mediator in a divorce action involving the son of an old friend. The couple insisted that they had no substantial disagreements and wished to avoid the costs of separate representation. Each spouse willingly signed an informed consent form acknowledging that you were serving as a mediator rather than an advocate, and that you had advised them to obtain independent counsel.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The couple was married for twelve years. The wife worked to put the husband through law school and then deferred paid employment for several years in order to care for their two children. She recently returned to her job as a nutrition consultant for medical facilities. The couple plans to share legal custody of the young children; the wife will have physical custody.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />After several sessions, the parties have reached an agreement. Although the terms clearly favor the husband, the settlement is still within the range of what you believe a court will approve. The agreement does, however, have several disturbing aspects. First, you have reason to believe that neither party may have been entirely candid in disclosing financial assets. You suspect that the wife receives consulting income that does not appear on the couple’s tax returns. You also believe that the husband has understated the potential value of separate property investments in technology companies that are soon likely to go public.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A second difficulty is that the wife has waived spousal maintenance and all interest in certain community property purchased by the husband with his salary income during the marriage. You do not believe that her income will be sufficient to adequately support herself and the children. You are uncertain whether the waiver is attributable to a sense of guilt, principles of fairness, a desire to get the proceedings over quickly, or an unwillingness to take a strong bargaining stance that would provoke conflict. You also have observed patterns of verbal and psychological abuse in the way that the husband relates to his wife. However, she denies that he has ever engaged in physical violence.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A final problem is that, in exchange for the wife’s financial concessions, the husband has agreed to reduce his claims for time with the children. He plans to see them only once a month, which you believe is inadequate for their needs. He will also cease taking them for visits to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page751" class="pagebreak" title="751">751</span>their paternal grandparents, whom the wife dislikes but the children adore.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What is your role if you believe that the financial agreement is unreasonably lopsided? How should you handle the financial disclosure issue? Suppose that you discuss the matters with each party separately and that both affirm their original financial statements without responding fully to your concerns? Are you obligated or permitted to raise your suspicions with the ignorant party or to conduct any independent investigation? How should you handle the husband’s concessions concerning visitation if you believe that they are not in the children’s best interests?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Assume that you do not further discuss your suspicions about financial disclosures with either party and that the couple disregards the concerns that you note about fairness and visitation. The court grants the divorce and incorporates the mediated settlement in the final decree. Subsequently, the wife decides to return to graduate school and seeks to reopen the decree. Among other things, she claims that her husband fraudulently concealed the true value of his investments and that you failed to inform her of that possibility or to provide adequate financial counseling. She also threatens to sue you for malpractice and seeks damages based on the cost of re-litigating the original agreement. What is your likely liability?<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1649" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1649" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Suppose the parties ask to conduct the mediation online. After some unproductive exchanges, the husband’s communications become increasingly hostile and include what may be veiled threats of abuse if the wife does not accept his terms. You wonder if the wife was entirely candid with you when she initially denied that the husband had engaged in physical violence.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What do you do? You are tempted to withdraw, but worry that it would leave the wife unprotected and signal to the husband that threats are effective bargaining strategies. Should you suggest outside counseling? Meet with the wife separately in person or in an on-line separate room? What can mediators do to anticipate and respond to such situations? </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How should the mediator have handled the disclosure issue in Problem 2? In a case with similar facts, a Missouri appellate court assumed <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that the attorney-mediator had breached his duties by failing to inquire fully into the husband’s financial affairs or to advise the wife to litigate the issue. However, the court dismissed the malpractice complaint because the plaintiff had failed to establish specific causation: that, if the attorney <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page752" class="pagebreak" title="752">752</span>acted differently, she would have obtained a better mediated settlement without the expense of litigation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1650" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1650" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How can lawyer-mediators minimize the risks of such complaints? For example, should mediators confront a party whom they suspect is lying in a private caucus and threaten to terminate the mediation unless full disclosure is made? Alternatively, would it be enough to require a sworn affidavit with financial disclosures?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1651" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1651" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As noted above, when it comes to mediation, problems of fairness of unequal bargaining power can loom large, and the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators permit, but do not require, mediators to withdraw rather than facilitate an unfair agreement. In commenting on this approach, Andrew Schepard, reporter for the Standards, notes that while they impose some requirements of procedural fairness, no dispute resolution process can “remedy fundamental preexisting inequities in power or legal entitlements between participants. That job is for legislatures or courts.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1652" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section22.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1652" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span> Do you agree? If you were a mediator and you thought the negotiating parties were poised to enter into a lopsided agreement, how would you proceed?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A related issue is the extent to which mediators should consider the interests of unrepresented and absent parties, such as children. Standard VIII of the ABA Model Standards of Practice for Family and Divorce Mediation states: “A family mediator shall assist participants in determining how to promote the best interests of the children.” Is that version preferable to other codes which impose a <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> duty on mediators to promote the best interest of the children? What would such standards require on the facts of Problem 2?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is your view of online mediation? Should legislators create an independent regulatory authority to prescribe and enforce ethical standards and qualifications for online mediators generally, or for those handling certain categories of cases? If so, what safeguards would be most important to include? Under what circumstances would you recommend to clients or friends that they engage in online mediation? </span>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many experts believe that certain cases are inappropriate for mediation. Matters involving domestic violence are a commonly cited example. According to critics, mediation places the parties on equal footing and invites compromise. As a result, it may lead to coercive bargaining and also fail to deter abuse. More fundamentally, in order for a mediation to succeed, both parties must display a genuine desire to settle the conflict, weaker parties must be able to assert their interests, and stronger parties must be willing to make genuine concessions. All this is often missing in cases involving domestic violence. Critics also claim that allowing mediation undermines the legal system’s “message to batterers that their conduct is illegal and </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;">mandatory</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> mediation to resolve child custody disputes. For example, California requires mediation for cases about child custody and visitation. These cases are most expected to benefit from mandatory mediation because they are often contentious, and because mediators in these areas tend to have relevant training in mental health and psychology. Additionally, some have commented that California likely adopted such legislation to help alleviate court congestion by removing these cases from court dockets.</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Should parties ever be compelled to mediate their disputes? Some note that the empowering potential of mediation is undermined when the process is imposed rather than chosen, particularly when it excludes advocates who can assert weaker parties’ rights.</span>

Lawyers, however, respond keenly to incentives, and the current custody system in states following “best interests” or similar standards provides a strong incentive to behave like Simon Legree. Lawyers who do not do so are sacrificing their clients’ interests in order to feel good about themselves; to the extent that clients figure this out, such lawyers are also likely to go broke. Those interested in ending such behavior should look to changes in the law that will put an end to such incentives, rather than pinning their hopes on any sudden change in the realities of legal practice in a world well supplied with Simon Legrees and economically disadvantaged women.</p>
