      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">American lawyers have long prided themselves on being part of a profession. Their status as professionals has been critical to attorneys’ self-esteem, social standing, and regulatory independence. Since the concept of professionalism carries so much significance for lawyers both individually and collectively, this book begins by trying to get a better sense of what exactly the concept means.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The term “profession” is both elastic and elusive. Its meaning has varied considerably over time and across cultures, and has inspired continued debate among contemporary social theorists. The most common definition, reflected in a report by the American Bar Association (ABA) Commission on Professionalism, has stressed professionals’ special expertise and ethical responsibilities. Borrowing from an influential work by Roscoe Pound, former Dean of Harvard Law School, the Commission defined professionalism as the practice of a “learned art in the spirit of a public service.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.32" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The need for occupational groups with special knowledge and moral commitments has, in turn, been thought to account for other distinguishing features of professions, such as ethical codes, regulatory autonomy, prescribed forms of training, and a monopoly over certain services. According to sociologist Eliot Freidson, whose definition is quoted with approval by the ABA Commission, a profession is:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">An occupation whose members have special privileges, such as exclusive licensing, that are justified by the following assumptions:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />That its practice requires substantial intellectual training and the use of complex judgments.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />That since clients cannot adequately evaluate the quality of the service, they must trust those they consult.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />That the client’s trust presupposes that the practitioner’s self-interest is overbalanced by devotion to serving both the client’s interest and the public good, and</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />That the occupation is self-regulating—that is, organized in such a way as to assure the public and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" class="pagebreak" title="14">14</span>courts that its members are competent, do not violate their client’s trust, and transcend their own self-interest.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.33" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.33" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">At the close of the 20th century, observers of the American legal profession declared that it was the “best of times and the worst of times” for lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.34" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span> Members of the bar enjoy great power, wealth, and status. The number of lawyers has more than doubled (from about 650,000 to 1.3 million) over the last three decades.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.35" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.35" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> Law is among the highest-paying professions and a common path to leadership in both the public and private sectors. Yet that overall prosperity has been accompanied by increasing competition, economic insecurity, and pressure. Consumer demand has limited the bar’s ability to preempt competition by nonlawyers for certain law-related services. (Accounting firms have made especially threatening inroads on the profession’s traditional turf.) At the same time, globalization has brought more foreign competitors to American financial centers and has also encouraged clients to outsource business to offshore legal service providers.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Other dynamics have reduced the need for lawyers and intensified competition for the legal work that remains. Technology is displacing demand for many lawyers’ services.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.36" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> Artificial intelligence and online service providers such as LegalZoom “aren’t just eating [law firms’] lunch; they are eying breakfast and dinner as well.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.37" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.37" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> As Richard Susskind has argued, the traditional customized model of lawyering is being replaced by commoditized legal work and the broader economy’s relentless pressure towards “more for less” will intensify this trend.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.38" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.38" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>So too, corporate clients, who are facing increased pressures in their own markets, have responded by curtailing legal costs. Businesses have moved more routine work in-house and parceled out more projects based on short-term competitive considerations rather than long-term lawyer-client relationships.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Escalating costs and competition have resulted in greater focus on the bottom line, and higher billable-hour requirements. In private practice, partnership means less and is harder to obtain. Recent law <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" class="pagebreak" title="15">15</span>graduates face a tougher job market with higher debt burdens than their predecessors. Moreover, among practitioners who represent primarily individual rather than corporate clients, the demand for services is relatively weak, nonlawyer competition has increased, and average earnings are modest. The consequence has been widening income disparities within the profession, and exceptionally high rates of stress, depression, and substance abuse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.39" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.39" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Still, despite such challenges, law continues to be a path to leadership in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. It also continues to offer a large number of lawyers an intellectual challenge, an opportunity for service, and a comfortable living. Also, to a much greater extent than other occupations, law gives its members significant control over their own regulation and workplace structures. To the extent that there are problems in the profession, lawyers have a unique opportunity to develop solutions.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Although the term “profession” did not come into use until around the 16th century, individuals have been performing services that we would now associate with the legal profession for at least two thousand years. By the fourth century B.C., advocates were assisting parties in Greek tribunals and were involved in counseling and legislative work. However, these individuals did not form a cohesive “profession” in the sense we that now use the term. Training was informal, ethical standards were lax, and discipline was lacking.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.40" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">A somewhat more professionalized culture developed in early Rome. Between the first and third centuries A.D., legal advisors and advocates began to form communities around the courts in major cities. These groups attempted to standardize training and provide some disciplinary oversight, as well as to assist the development of a systematic jurisprudence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.41" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">With the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, this professional tradition also declined. Early Anglo-Saxon methods of dispute resolution, particularly trials by ordeal, presented less need for trained advocates. However, in England, after the Norman conquerors imported certain innovations, including trial by jury, the usefulness of partisan assistance increased.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.42" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.42" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> During the 12th and 13th centuries, the foundations for a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" class="pagebreak" title="16">16</span>professional community began to emerge. This community was highly stratified, however, with different specialties having monopolies over certain functions and certain courts. Ultimately, the English bar divided into two groups. The most elite were the barristers, who provided trial representation and received training by attending one of several Inns of Court and then by serving as apprentices to practicing barristers. The remaining legal work was performed by solicitors, who were governed by rules of court and professional associations, supplemented by legislation. That division remains in contemporary Great Britain, although the boundaries have blurred over the last quarter-century, and areas of overlapping jurisdiction have increased.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">By contrast, the American bar began without such formal stratification. Although the 17th and 18th centuries were not “friendly years for lawyers,” they were, as historian Lawrence Friedman puts it, “a necessary evil. . . . As soon as a settled society posed problems for which lawyers had an answer or at least a skill, lawyers began to thrive, despite the hostility.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.43" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.43" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> Friedman notes that the profession grew rapidly in the late 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1900, there were over a hundred thousand practitioners. The American bar was a “nimble profession” and quickly adapted to the out of court needs of an evolving society. According to Friedman, “its nimbleness was no doubt due to the character of the bar: open-ended, unrestricted, uninhibited, attractive to sharp ambitious men.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.44" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.44" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> During this early period, the bar tried to raise standards, “tried to limit entry into the field, and (above all) tried to resist conversion of the profession into a ‘mere’ business or trade.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.45" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.45" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> The bar’s efforts were only partly successful, but lawyers did occupy a special status in American life, for reasons Alexis de Tocqueville famously highlighted during his visit to the early republic.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">Vol. I, 283–90 (H. Reeve trans., P. Bradley ed., F. Bowen rev., 1973) (1st ed. 1835).</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In visiting the Americans and studying their laws, we perceive that the authority they have entrusted to members of the legal profession, and the influence that these individuals exercise in the government, are the most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy. This effect seems to me to result from a general cause, which it is useful to investigate, as it may be reproduced elsewhere. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Men who have made a special study of the laws derive from this occupation certain habits of order, a taste for formalities, and a kind of instinctive regard for the regular connection of ideas, which naturally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page17" class="pagebreak" title="17">17</span>render them very hostile to the revolutionary spirit and the unreflecting passions of the multitude. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Some of the tastes and the habits of the aristocracy may consequently be discovered in the characters of lawyers. They participate in the same instinctive love of order and formalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of the multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the people. I do not mean to say that the natural propensities of lawyers are sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most other men, are governed by their private interests, and especially by the interests of the moment.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In a state of society in which the members of the legal profession cannot hold that rank in the political world which they enjoy in private life, we may rest assured that they will be the foremost agents of revolution. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Lawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration, and the best security of public order is authority. It must not be forgotten, also, that if they prize freedom much, they generally value legality still more: they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and, provided the legislature undertakes of itself to deprive men of their independence, they are not dissatisfied. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The government of democracy is favorable to the political power of lawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince are excluded from the government, the lawyers take possession of it, in their own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information and sagacity, beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of the popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes towards the aristocracy and the prince, they are brought in contact with the people by their interests. They like the government of democracy without participating in its propensities and without imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a two-fold authority from it and over it. The people in democratic states do not mistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is known that they are interested to serve the popular cause; and the people listen to them without irritation, because they do not attribute to them any sinister designs. The lawyers do not, indeed, wish to overthrow the institutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor to turn it away from its real direction by means that are foreign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth and interest, and to the aristocracy by habit and taste; they may be looked upon as the connecting link between the two great classes of society.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The profession of the law is the only aristocratic element that can be amalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy and be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I am not ignorant of the defects inherent in the character of this body of men; but without this admixture of lawyer-like sobriety with the democratic principle, I question whether democratic institutions could long be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" class="pagebreak" title="18">18</span>maintained; and I cannot believe that a republic could hope to exist at the present time if the influence of lawyers in public business did not increase in proportion to the power of the people.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">This aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal profession, is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in England than in any other country. This proceeds not only from the legal studies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature of the law and the position which these interpreters of it occupy in the two countries. The English and the Americans have retained the law of precedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions and the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and decisions of their predecessors. In the mind of an English or American lawyer a taste and a reverence for what is old is almost always united with a love of regular and lawful proceedings. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In America there are no nobles or literary men, and the people are apt to mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political class and the most cultivated portion of society. They have therefore nothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to their natural taste for public order. If I were asked where I place the American aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation that it is not among the rich, who are united by no common tie, but that it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States, the more we shall be persuaded that the lawyers, as a body, form the most powerful, if not the only, counterpoise to the democratic element. In that country we easily perceive how the legal profession is qualified by its attributes, and even by its faults, to neutralize the vices inherent in popular government. When the American people are intoxicated by passion or carried away by the impetuosity of their ideas, they are checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of their legal counselors. These secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to the nation’s democratic instincts, their superstitious attachment to what is old to its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and their habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The influence of legal habits extends beyond the precise limits I have pointed out. Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question. Hence all parties are obliged to borrow, in their daily controversies, the ideas, and even the language, peculiar to judicial proceedings. As most public men are or have been legal practitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their profession into the management of public affairs. The jury extends this habit to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their walls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest classes, so that at last the whole people contract the habits and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" class="pagebreak" title="19">19</span>the tastes of the judicial magistrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which is but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar to itself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the exigencies of the time and accommodates itself without resistance to all the movements of the social body. But this party extends over the whole community and penetrates into all the classes which compose it; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but finally fashions it to suit its own purposes.</p>

Accounts by frontier lawyers during the mid-19th century indicate that many practitioners were barely able to piece together a livelihood, and that much of their difficulty stemmed from the absence of public respect. Young attorneys often reported considerable difficulty in receiving payment for services they provided. As one struggling Texan wrote home to relatives, “I wish the fees came in half as fast as the cases.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.47" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.47" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Over the last century, the American bar has become increasingly fractured and specialized, and the work lives of lawyers in various fields are often quite different. In a landmark study of the Chicago bar, first published in 1980 and updated in 1998, sociologists John Heinz and Edward Laumann portrayed a profession sharply divided into two hemispheres. Most lawyers represented either individuals and small businesses or large organizations such as corporations, unions, and the government. Few ever “crossed the equator” and those serving corporations and large organizations generally were of a higher socioeconomic status.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.51" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.51" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Accordingly, Heinz and Laumann argued that the traditional view of the bar as a single, unified profession no longer fit the facts.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[The lawyer who commutes to Brussels or Tokyo to negotiate international franchise agreements] will have little in common with the lawyer who haunts the corridors of the criminal courts hoping that a bailiff will, in return for a consideration, commend his services to some poor wretch charged with a barroom assault. Both of those private practitioners will differ from the government-employed lawyers who prosecute criminal cases or who practice public international law in the employ of the State Department, as the two sorts of government-employed lawyers differ from one another.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.52" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.52" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In the 1998 update of their study, Heinz and Laumann found that the income gap between corporate and non-corporate practitioners had widened. Demand for services had grown more rapidly in the business sector, and by the late 1990s, about 60 percent of lawyers’ time was devoted to corporate clients compared with half in the 1970s. It thus appeared doubtful that the profession’s current organizational structures <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" class="pagebreak" title="21">21</span>“provided enough interchange to produce a bar that functioned as a community of common pursuit.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.53" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.53" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">A pathbreaking study of new lawyers by the American Bar Foundation and the National Association of Law Placement also provides a window into how the bar is evolving. The study, <span style="font-style: italic;">After the JD</span>, is following a national cross-section of 5000 lawyers who all passed the bar in 2000. The study’s first report (AJD1) describes lawyers’ careers two to three years into practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.54" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.54" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> The second (AJD2) examines the trajectory of the lawyers’ careers after roughly seven years of practice, and the third (AJD3) reports on those careers after twelve years.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.55" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.55" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> According to AJD3, these lawyers are significantly more diverse than their predecessors: 50.4 percent are women, up from 5 percent in 1970, and 17.2 percent are nonwhite, compared to 5 percent in 1970. In terms of religious affiliation, 30 percent are Protestant, 27 percent Roman Catholic, 7 percent Jewish, and 23 percent report no religious affiliation. Most come from relatively privileged backgrounds. About two-thirds had fathers who graduated from college, and half had college-graduate mothers, a figure three times the national average.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In the third wave of the study, just under half (48.5 percent) were working in the private law firm sector, 28 percent were in the public sector, 20 percent were in business, and 3.5 percent were in “other” settings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.56" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.56" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> More recent figures from the ABA and National Association of Law Placement suggest that immediately upon graduation, most lawyers go into private practice, about 10 to 13 percent land in business, 12 to 13 percent work for the government, 10 to 11 percent clerk, 12 percent entered the government, and 5 to 7 percent joined public interest organizations.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.57" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.57" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> The work lives of lawyers have also changed as workloads have increased. In AJD3 the median work week was forty-seven hours compared with forty hours for full-time American workers. However, roughly 15 percent of responding lawyers (most in large firms) reported working sixty hours a week or more.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.58" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.58" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> Complexity and specialization in work have also escalated. At the turn of the 20th century, most lawyers were generalists; now most are specialists and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" class="pagebreak" title="22">22</span>project managers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.59" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.59" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> About three-quarters of the lawyers in AJD3 reported that at least half of their work is in a single substantive field.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.60" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.60" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> Job mobility has also increased. Within the first three years of practice, a majority of lawyers had changed jobs at least once, and in the next five years, a majority had changed jobs again.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.61" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.61" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> </p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">During much of the 18th and 19th centuries, gender defined the geography of American life, and a woman’s primary place was in the domestic rather than the professional sphere. There were, however, exceptions to this general pattern. Particularly in the Colonial Era, when labor was scarce and relatively few occupations required formal licenses, some white women managed to participate in legal transactions either by acting as their husbands’ representatives or successors, or by obtaining special authorization to proceed as independent agents. Few of these women, however, managed to attain positions of significant public power or recognition, and those who did generally acquired an anomalous status. The first American female attorney was an “honorary male” in a literal as well as figurative sense; she was frequently addressed in person and in 17th-century court records as Gentleman Margaret Brent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.62" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">During the late 18th century, the gradual formalization of bar admission criteria made it increasingly difficult for women to act as lawyers. And, of course, African American women under slavery had no capacity to assert legal rights. However, after the Civil War, the expansion of women’s educational opportunities and political activism contributed to a growing stream of female applicants to the bar. In 1867, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" class="pagebreak" title="23">23</span>Iowa became the first state to license a woman attorney, and the following decades witnessed a gradual increase in female candidates from largely white middle- and upper-middle-class backgrounds.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Women’s initial reception in most jurisdictions was less than enthusiastic. In a celebrated 1873 decision denying Myra Bradwell admission to the Illinois bar, three concurring Supreme Court Justices invested the sexes’ “separate spheres” with both spiritual and constitutional significance:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The family organization, which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood. The harmony, not to say identity, of interests and views which belong[s], or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and independent career from that of her husband.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.63" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.63" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Although the precise method of divine communication was never elaborated, it remained accessible to other decisionmakers as well. Judges in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia similarly concluded that women’s nature was to nurture, and that any professional pursuits constituted a departure from the natural order and “when voluntary, treason against it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.64" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.64" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> As one late 19th-century judge explained, the “peculiar qualities of womanhood, its gentle graces, its quick sensibility, [and] its tender susceptibility” were surely not qualifications for “forensic strife.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.65" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.65" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Many female applicants, however, remained unconvinced. By the turn of the century, various political, legal, and social forces had coalesced to secure women’s rights to admission in about half the states, and by 1920, formal barriers were largely removed. Informal obstacles, however, remained. “Bring on as many women lawyers as you choose,” predicted one District of Columbia judge, “I do not believe they will be a success.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.66" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.66" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> Clarence Darrow agreed. As he explained in an early 20th-century address to a group of Chicago women attorneys: “You can’t be shining lights at the bar because you are too kind. You can never be corporation lawyers because you are not cold-blooded. You have not a high grade of intellect.” Although conceding that female practitioners <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" class="pagebreak" title="24">24</span>might be acceptable as counsel for divorce and nonpaying criminal cases, he doubted that women would “ever make a living” in the law.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.67" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Such attitudes became self-fulfilling prophecies. Female professionals who rejected their maternal mission were typically treated as social deviants, but women who restricted work to raise families were denounced for squandering educational opportunities that should be reserved for full-time male breadwinners. Many bar associations and law schools denied female applicants or limited their admission. Harvard Law School remained all-male until 1950 and not until 1972 did all accredited law schools eliminate explicit sex-based restrictions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.68" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.68" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> Substantial disparities also prevailed in hiring, salaries, and promotion. Private firms frequently declined to employ women, and almost no rationalization was too trivial. As one Wall Street partner explained to a female applicant, much as his firm would like to hire a woman, the logistical difficulties were simply too great: she couldn’t use the attorneys’ bathroom; she couldn’t be relegated to the secretaries’ bathroom; and the firm couldn’t afford to build another facility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.69" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.69" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span> In 1960, women constituted less than 3 percent of the American bar, and were largely excluded from fields of practice with the greatest status, influence, and financial rewards.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.70" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.70" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Major changes came with the rise of the contemporary women’s movement and the broader social, economic, and demographic changes that it reflected. By 1983, women constituted over a third of new entrants to the profession, and by the turn of the century, about half.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.71" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> But as subsequent discussion indicates, their position remains far from equal.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Barriers of race and ethnicity have been similarly significant. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many employers, educators, and bar associations openly discriminated against immigrants from Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as Jews from all ethnic backgrounds.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.72" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.72" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> A 1939 report found that Jewish lawyers accounted for half the practitioners in New York City, but few were working in corporate firms; the exceptions were mainly in firms with predominantly Jewish clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.73" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.73" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Racial discrimination has been particularly pervasive and persistent. Although the first black lawyer was admitted to the bar in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" class="pagebreak" title="25">25</span>1844 (Macon Allen, Maine), few blacks had any realistic possibility of bar membership until after the Civil War. The family of the first black to graduate from a law school (George Ruffin, Harvard, 1869) came from Virginia, where it had been a crime to teach any black person to read.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.74" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.74" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> Discriminatory admission policies, inadequate educational backgrounds, and lack of financial resources restricted access to law school, and the small number of lawyers of color restricted opportunities for apprenticeships. At the turn of the 20th century, there were only about 730 black lawyers in the entire country.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.75" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.75" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> Once admitted to the bar, minority lawyers faced continued resistance from potential employers and clients. Few firms were willing to hire lawyers of color, and African Americans who could afford the services of an attorney often hired whites, who were assumed to function more effectively in a racist legal system.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Barriers to women of color were especially great. Access to higher educational and professional programs was extremely limited, and the few institutions that did not discriminate on the basis of race often did so on the basis of sex. Charlotte Ray, one of the first black women to graduate from law school (Howard, 1873), gained admittance by using her initials rather than first name on application papers. After an unsuccessful struggle to obtain legal work, she returned to her earlier career of teaching in public schools. Between 1875 and 1925, no more than twenty-five black women were reportedly practicing law. By 1940, the number had only doubled.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.76" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.76" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In 1890, when the census first began classifying by race, black lawyers constituted under 0.5 percent of the profession; in 1960 they were slightly over 1 percent. Not until the late 1940s was an African American appointed to the federal bench or to the full-time faculty of a non-minority law school.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.77" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.77" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> Although the Supreme Court held racially segregated legal education unconstitutional in 1950, it took the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s to bring major changes. And even then, in 1968, only about 3 percent of law students were black, Latino, or Native American.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.78" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> Then, with affirmative action and financial aid initiatives, the numbers increased; by 2019, students of color constituted about one-fifth of law school graduates. Despite such progress, substantial challenges remain. </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The same is true for LGBTQ lawyers, whose history in the legal profession paralleled their experience in society generally. Until the late 1960s, criminal prohibitions on homosexual conduct and cultural <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" class="pagebreak" title="26">26</span>assumptions about sexual “deviance” inhibited public expression of gay and lesbian identity. Individuals whose non-heterosexual practices became known suffered substantial sanctions, including pervasive discrimination in employment. Law was no exception, although the closeted nature of most homosexual practices presented few occasions for bar pronouncements. During the 1950s and 1960s, there were only three reported judicial cases concerning the denial of professional licenses to gays and lesbians, and only one involved an attorney. In 1955, Harris Kimball, a Florida civil rights attorney, was disbarred after being convicted of having sexual relations with another man on an Orlando beach.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.79" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Beginning in the 1970s, the growth of the gay rights movement contributed to substantial changes. Partly in response to such activism, as well as to new research and new interpretations of prior research, in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Legal challenges to discrimination based on sexual orientation also began to achieve limited success, including in the legal profession. In 1973, on a petition from Harris Kimball, the New York Court of Appeals became the first state to hold that homosexuality was not a ground for exclusion from the bar.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.80" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.80" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> A series of bar admission cases in Florida subsequently prompted its supreme court to limit moral character scrutiny to inquiries bearing a “rational relationship to fitness for legal practice,” and to determine that private noncommercial sexual acts between consenting adults bore no such relationship.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.81" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.81" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> And, beginning in the late 1970s, a number of organizations, including the National Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association, formed to provide support networks and press for changes on issues involving sexual orientation. Still, until relatively recently, a common attitude was that expressed by one legal employer in a Los Angeles bar survey about gay and lesbian attorneys in the mid-1990s: “Don’t have any. Don’t want any.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.82" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.82" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The legal profession has a substantial stake in increasing diversity and inclusion and a growing number of bar leaders recognize as much. Indeed, in one recent survey of managing partners and general counsel, participants stressed that diversity was not just the “right thing to do,” but was also critical to organizations’ economic success. As one put it, “A <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" class="pagebreak" title="27">27</span>diverse team is a more effective team: it has a broader base of experience . . . and the client gets a better product.” Another agreed. “We’re in the human capital business. [Diversity is a way to get] the best people and the best decisionmaking.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.83" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.83" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Research on the business case for diversity generally distinguishes between “cognitive diversity,” which refers to differences in information, knowledge, perspectives, and mental models, and “identity diversity,” which refers to differences in race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, physical qualities, and sexual orientation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.84" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.84" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> Although logically distinct, these two forms of diversity are related because our identities influence what we know, how we perceive events, and how we think.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.85" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Because of that relationship, identity diversity generally leads to better outcomes in non-routine cognitive tasks such as problem solving, predicting and innovating. Researchers find that “even if the person who looks ‘different’ does not bring any new cognitive differences to the table, his or her mere presence has been shown to change the behavior of the group’s members. People work harder in identity-diverse environments than they do in homogenous environments.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.86" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span> Insular cultures have a harder time recognizing the need for change. They tend to resist insights of outsiders and don’t learn and adapt.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.87" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.87" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span> Homogeneity triggers expectations of similarity and less welcoming receptions for different opinions. Diverse groups are more accepting of alternative viewpoints, more willing to reexamine facts and assumptions, and more likely to foster persistent voicing of dissenting perspectives.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.88" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.88" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span> People anticipating a homogeneous environment also prepare less thoroughly than those anticipating a diverse interaction.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.89" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.89" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although the business case for diversity is widely accepted in principle, diversity is often marginalized in practice. Part of the reason may be that findings on its impact are not uniformly favorable. Not all social science research reflects strong, bottom-line benefits from diversity. If poorly managed, diversity can heighten conflict, discomfort, and communication problems, or cause outsiders to suppress divergent views.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.90" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.90" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> The diversity <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page28" class="pagebreak" title="28">28</span>bonus tends not to materialize for tasks where familiarity, trust, and shared understandings are especially critical.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.91" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span> Nor do all studies find a correlation between diversity and profitability.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.92" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span> In those that do, it is unclear which way causation runs. It may well be that financial success sometimes enhances diversity rather than the converse. Organizations that are on strong financial footing are better able to invest in diversity initiatives or have sound employment practices that promote both diversity and profitability.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.93" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.93" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some believe that, even if diversity has quantifiable advantages in enhancing decisionmaking, the benefits need to be weighed against the adverse effects of “lowering” standards and provoking backlash based on “identity politics” and “special” treatment.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.94" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.94" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span> In a study by the Minority Corporate Counsel Association, many white men agreed that “diversity should take a back seat to performance and capability.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.95" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.95" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span> In their view, too much “reverse discrimination” causes resentment, and “stretch hires of minorities who are not qualified sometimes does much to undermine . . . acceptance of diversity and inclusion.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.96" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span> As one participant put it, “Taking opportunities . . . from those with merit and giving [them] . . . to people based upon race, gender, or sexual identity is forcing us apart not bringing us together. . . . I can think of few things worse for an ostensibly color blind and meritocratic society.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.97" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.97" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> How would you respond to these concerns?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />By contrast, supporters of diversity initiatives, relying on research summarized below, argue that they are necessary to counteract unconscious biases that limit opportunities for qualified women and minorities. Pretending that we already live in a strictly meritocratic society will not bring us closer to achieving one. Advocates of diversity also point out that it promotes effective leadership by ensuring difference in backgrounds and perspectives, and by enhancing the quality and legitimacy of decisionmaking processes.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.98" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.98" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span> They also note that leaders in today’s multicultural society need “cultural competence”: the ability to understand differences arising from diverse backgrounds and experiences and to adjust their own actions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page29" class="pagebreak" title="29">29</span>accordingly.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.99" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.99" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span> Do you think that it is particularly important for lawyers to display cultural competence?

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Although the legal profession has made major efforts to improve diversity and inclusion over the last half century, women and lawyers of color still confront substantial obstacles. Women now constitute close to half of law school graduates, but remain underrepresented in leadership, partner, and trial counsel positions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.100" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.100" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span> The American Bar Foundation’s longitudinal survey of 5000 lawyers, AJD3<span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> found that about half of women and two-thirds of men in law firms were partners. Of the partners, about two-thirds of men and half of women were equity partners. In the private sector, the gender gap in income was 20 percent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.101" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.101" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> In other more recent studies, the gender gap in pay at large firms was 53 percent, which has increased in recent years and which experts attribute primarily to differences in rainmaking and skill in taking credit for rainmaking.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.102" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.102" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span> </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Perceptions of the problem vary by gender. Sixty percent of women in law firms, compared with 14 percent of men, think that gender will limit their advancement opportunities, and less than half of women, compared with two-thirds of men, think that firms are doing what it takes to improve gender diversity.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.103" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.103" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> Only 11 percent of male partners, compared with 67 percent of female partners, believe there is a gender pay gap.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.104" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.104" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span></p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">The barriers confronting women, LGBTQ lawyers, and lawyers of color have overlapping but also distinctive explanations. All groups encounter unconscious bias and stereotypes, devaluation of competence, special scrutiny that accompanies token status, exclusion from informal networks of advice and assistance, lack of quality assignments, and a paucity of mentors and role models. Explanations for racial and ethnic inequalities also include class barriers. Together with racial bias, these barriers diminish minorities’ aspirations and opportunities to enter law school and constrain their performance and advancement once they graduate.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.110" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.110" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> In addition, barriers of race and ethnicity intersect with barriers of class and sexual orientation. As the materials in Chapter 16 reflect, racial minorities’ underrepresentation in the law school applicant pool is partly attributable to inadequate financial resources and educational preparation. These factors limit the talent pool of lawyers of color.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">Women are less likely to make partner even controlling for other factors, including law school grades and time spent out of the work force or on part-time schedules. Studies find that men are two to five times more likely to make partner than women.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Even women who never take time out of the labor force and who work long hours have a lower chance of partnership than similarly situated men. The situation is bleakest at the highest levels. </span>Only 12 percent of chairs and managing partners at the largest 100 firms are female. . . . <span style="color: #000000;">Gender disparities are similarly apparent in compensation, </span>with minority women at the bottom of the financial pecking order. <span style="color: #000000;">Those differences persist even after controlling for factors such as productivity and differences in equity/non-equity status. </span>So too, although female lawyers report about the same overall <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page31" class="pagebreak" title="31">31</span>career satisfaction as their male colleagues, women experience greater dissatisfaction with key dimensions of practice such as level of responsibility, recognition for work, and chances for advancement. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">[These gender disparities are] commonly explained in terms not of credentials but of commitment and client development. Because women continue to have disproportionate family responsibilities and are more likely to reduce their schedules or to take time out of the workplace than men, they are assumed to be less available, less dependable, and less worthy of extensive mentoring. In one survey, although women and men reported working similar hours, more than a quarter of male lawyers thought their female counterparts worked less and a fifth rated the number of hours these women worked as “fair to poor.” So too, women are often presumed to be less adept in business development and in the self-promotional abilities that underlie it. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Gender stereotypes play a well-documented, often unconscious, role in American culture, and legal workplaces are no exception. . . . In national surveys, between a third and three-quarters of female lawyers believe that they are held to higher standards than their colleagues. Studies of performance evaluations find some support for those perceptions; they find that similar descriptions of performance result in lower ratings for women than men. Male achievements are more likely to be attributed to capabilities, and female achievements to external factors . . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Women, particularly women of color, also receive less latitude for mistakes. As one African American attorney put it, “there is no room for error.” That, in turn, may make lawyers reluctant to seek risky “stretch assignments” that would demonstrate outstanding capabilities. Biased assumptions about lawyers’ commitment or competence can also affect the allocation of work. As Joan Williams and Veta Richardson note, the result is to prevent women and minorities from getting opportunities that would demonstrate or enhance their capabilities, which creates a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies . . . . </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">So too, mothers, even those working full-time, are assumed to be less available and committed, an assumption not made about fathers. In one representative study, almost three-quarters of female lawyers reported that their career commitment had been questioned when they gave birth or adopted a child. Only 9 percent of their white male colleagues, and 15 percent of minority male colleagues, had faced similar challenges. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Women are also rated lower than men on qualities associated with leadership, such as assertiveness, competitiveness, and business development. And . . . when women do display assertiveness, it is often penalized. Female lawyers risk seeming too feminine or not feminine enough. Either they may appear too “soft” or too “strident—either unable to make tough decisions or too pushy and arrogant to command respect. . . . Even the most accomplished lawyers can encounter such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page32" class="pagebreak" title="32">32</span>biases. Brooksley Born, now widely acclaimed for her efforts to regulate high-risk derivatives while chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was dismissed at the time as “abrasive,” “strident” and a “lightweight wacko.” . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">A related set of obstacles involves<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>in-group favoritism. . . . In ABA research, 62 percent of women of color and 60 percent of white women, but only 4 percent of white men, felt excluded from formal and informal networking opportunities; most women and minorities would have liked better mentoring. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">In-group favoritism is also apparent in the allocation of work and client development opportunities. Many organizations operate with informal systems that channel seemingly talented junior lawyers (disproportionately white men), to leadership tracks, while relegating others to “workhorse” positions. In the ABA Commission study, 44 percent of women of color, 39 percent of white women, and 25 percent of minority men reported being passed over for desirable assignments; only 2 percent of white men noted similar experiences. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Escalating workplace demands and inflexible workplace structures pose further obstacles to gender equity . . . Although more than 90 percent of American law firms report policies permitting part-time work, only about 6 percent of lawyers actually use them. Many lawyers believe, with good reason, that any reduction in hours or availability would jeopardize their careers. P<span style="color: #000000;">art-time status and time out of the workforce generally result in long-term losses in earnings as well as lower chances for partnership. In one survey of University of Michigan law school graduates, just a single year out of the workforce correlated with a third lower chances of making partner and an earnings reduction of 38 percent . . . . All too common are s</span>tories of the “faster than a speeding bullet” maternity leave or women in hospital delivery rooms drafting documents while timing contractions. If you’re billing at 6 minute intervals, why waste one? Those who opt for a reduced schedule after parental leave often find that it isn’t worth the price. Their schedules aren’t respected, their hours creep up, the quality of their assignments goes down, their pay is not proportional, and they are stigmatized as “slackers” . . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-bottom: 3.25pt; margin-top: 3.25pt;" class="TextParagraph">Although work-family conflicts are not only “women’s issues,” women suffer the greatest cost. . . . Despite a significant increase in men’s domestic work over the last two decades, women continue to shoulder the major burden. It is still women who are most likely to get the phone call that federal district judge Nancy Gertner received on the first day that she was about to ascend the bench: “Mama, there’s no chocolate pudding in my [lunch].” And it was a mother, not her equally busy husband, who heard from her resentful child, “I want to be a client when I grow up.” <span style="color: #000000;">In the American Bar Foundation’s survey of young lawyers, women were about seven times more likely than men to be working part-time or to be out of the labor force, primarily due to childcare</span>. . . .</p>

Studies find that about 25 percent of women, 7 percent of white men, and 11 percent of men of color have reported encountering conduct including “unwanted sexual comments, physical contact, and/or romantic advances.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.111" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.111" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> The vast majority of this conduct goes unreported because victims fear retaliation, humiliation, and informal blacklisting, or because they doubt that any meaningful response will be forthcoming.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.112" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.112" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> Even when legal employers do impose sanctions or terminate the offender, they often do not disclose that fact publicly, which enables serial abusers to avoid exposure.<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.113" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.113" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span> Although firms may ask about complaints when hiring laterally, many do not vet the answers or ask for references in order to avoid alerting competitors that one of their attorneys is being recruited. </p>

He alleged that, after he returned from leave, partners withheld work, and that the firm had a “macho culture,” in which associates bragged about how little time they spent on family obligations. The court granted the firm <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page34" class="pagebreak" title="34">34</span>summary judgment on the discrimination claim on the ground that the plaintiff “offered no evidence that his termination for low billable hours was actually a pretext for terminating him because he was a male who was also a caregiver.” The trial judge held, however, that there was a triable issue of fact on whether low billable hours was a pretext for retaliation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.118" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.118" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> </p>

Explanations proceed on several levels. One framework stresses the historical, socioeconomic and political forces that help determine when and which groups become targets of subordination. According to some theorists, social and economic dislocation that generates widespread anxiety often triggers a search for scapegoats. So too, groups that have achieved dominance generally seek to legitimize their position by magnifying group differences.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.119" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.119" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span> Early socialization processes leave individuals with images, assumptions, and expectations that inhibit later efforts to build cross-racial relationships of comfort and equality.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.120" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.120" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Other explanations, informed by cognitive psychology, stress the role of social categories in perpetrating racial stereotypes. Individuals’ needs to simplify experience, to maintain group affiliations, and to believe in a “just world” often result in assigning characteristics to subordinate groups that explain their subordination. Most people want to assume that life follows orderly, predictable, and equitable patterns in which everyone gets what they deserve and deserves what they get. To sustain this view, people will often adjust their evaluations of merit to justify existing inequalities.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Because individuals are largely unaware of their biases, researchers have developed tests of implicit attitudes, some of which are available online. Such tests find, for example, that both white and black subjects more readily associate positive words and images with whites than blacks; the association is strong for white survey participants, and weak for blacks. This pattern is consistent with other laboratory studies finding that black students show explicit attitudes that are strongly favorable to their own racial group, but implicit associations that are not. Such findings reflect the strength of racial stereotypes even among individuals whose conscious beliefs are to the contrary.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> This research suggests that one reason racism is so difficult to eradicate is that racial categorization and stereotypes are learned at early ages largely through tacit rather than explicit instruction. These biases are then perpetuated through selective perception of information that confirms them.</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The problem is compounded by our discomfort with acknowledging and addressing racial and ethnic bias.

One involved adult volunteers who evaluated Asian American and white male attorneys’ performance at simulated depositions. All of the volunteers heard the same recording of the deposition, but at the beginning they were shown photographs and names of the fictitious attorneys taking the depositions. Half the volunteers saw a white attorney named William Cole, and half saw an Asian American attorney named Sung Chang. After listening to the deposition, participants rated the deposition performance. Individuals who claimed that they themselves did not hold racial stereotypes about the ideal litigator but thought that most Americans held those stereotypes, gave lower ratings of competence and likeability to the Asian American litigator and were also less willing to hire Sung Chang or recommend him to friends and family.</span>

The reviewers gave the memo attributed to the white man a rating of 4.1 on a scale of 5, and a rating to the African American of 3.2.

Researchers have documented striking and stubborn patterns of women’s underrepresentation as first chairs at trial and in speaking roles in litigation proceedings. For example, one study by the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession, based on a random sample of 600 civil and criminal cases, revealed that: </p>

After he conferred with her repeatedly, I would ask myself why she wasn’t doing the arguing, since she knew the case cold.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In December 2018, Paul Weiss, one of the nation’s most prominent law firms posted photos of twelve smiling lawyers with the message that it was “proud to announce” its new partner class.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.135" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.135" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span> The smiles didn’t last. All the new partners were white, all but one was male, and the post went viral. What made it a lightning rod for pent up frustration about diversity was not simply the composition of the class: Many Wall Street firms’ records were far worse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.136" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.136" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> Rather, it was the firm’s seeming failure to recognize its problem and anticipate the likely response. The firm’s Chair, Brad Karp, promptly issued a statement indicating that the demographic pool for 2018 partners was “idiosyncratic,” and promised that “we certainly can—and will—do better. There is no more important issue to [this firm’s leadership] than diversity.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.137" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.137" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span> He also predicted that the firm would shortly hire more minority partners laterally, and that diversity efforts would receive greater attention in compensation decisions. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Media followup revealed a mixed picture. Although Paul Weiss’s partnership is more diverse than the vast majority of its large firm peers, that is a fairly low standard. Interviews with current and former lawyers at the firms suggested that many feel that the landscape is far from equal. Some felt that women and lawyers of color were held to more exacting standards, punished more severely for mistakes, and given less professional and client development opportunities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.138" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.138" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span> Promotion rates were consistent with those claims.

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Not all Americans are troubled by those disparities, although most are reluctant to express their views openly. One exception was the author of a letter to the editor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times </span>in response to its profile of Paul Weiss. He wrote: </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Perhaps I am being naive, but why does diversity have to be the primary yardstick in our society for every decision <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page38" class="pagebreak" title="38">38</span>involving the selection of human beings for elevated positions? There are times when ability should outweigh diversity . . . . In this case, Paul Weiss already had an excellent record when it came to diversity, but it is a law firm in the business of winning cases for its clients. Paul, Weiss did not deserve this pubic shaming because in this one instance the two metrics of diversity and ability were not in sync . . . . Clients do not want their attorneys to fight the good fight [on social issues]; they want them to win.

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">We expect the outside law firms we retain to reflect the diversity of the legal community and the companies and the customers we serve. . . . We are disappointed to see that many law firms continue to promote partners classes that in no way reflect the demographic composition of entering associate classes. Partnership classes remain largely male and largely white. . . . We are left to wonder if you and your partners value diversity enough to put into place programs to develop, promote, and retain talented and diverse attorneys. . . . We, as a group, will direct our substantial outside counsel spend to those firms that manifest results with respect to diversity and inclusion, in addition to providing the highest degree of quality representation. We sincerely hope that you and your firm will be among those that demonstrate this commitment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.141" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.141" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> </p>

Ask yourselves how many of these same GCs take any real measures to diversify the lawyers they hire on the meaningful matters. Very few do. . . . To be clear, my goal in penning this letter is not to ascribe blame or solicit work from GCs. My goal is to voice the frustration of dozens of racially diverse lawyers like me, who are quite frankly tired of these types of letters and pronouncements leading to no meaningful advancement.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.142" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.142" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Paul Barrett’s profile, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Good Black</span>, provides a case history of the profession’s difficulties in addressing diversity-related issues. It chronicles the efforts of Lawrence Mungen, an African American graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, to fit the ideal that Barrett’s title invokes. As a senior associate, Mungen joined the Washington, D.C. branch office of a Chicago law firm, Katten, Muchen and Zavis, and attempted to “play by the rules.” After being hired to do complex bankruptcy work in an office that generated too little of it, he fell through the cracks and off the partnership track. But until late in the process, Mungen failed to complain or to raise race-related concerns. He didn’t want to be typecast as the “angry black,” and he declined to support or mentor any of the small number of other minority lawyers at the firm.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When his difficulty in obtaining work became clear, some partners made a few well-meaning but ineffectual responses. They slashed his billing rate, which enabled him to take over some routine matters, but also undermined his reputation as someone capable of demanding, partnership-caliber work. Although the senior partners eventually offered to relocate him to another office, they did not provide assurances of opportunities that would lead to promotion. He sued for race discrimination and alleged multiple examples, such as the firm’s failure to provide formal evaluations, informal mentoring, invitations to client meetings, or help with business development. A largely black District of Columbia jury found in his favor, but a divided appellate panel reversed. Unable to find another comparable position, Mungen made do with temporary, low-level assignments at other firms and, by the end of the book, was contemplating an alternative career.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As many commentators have noted, the case was a kind of “racial Rorschach test” in which observers saw what they expected to see. To lawyers in the firm and sympathizers outside it, including the appellate court, this was a morality play in which no good deed went unpunished. From their perspective, Mungen was treated no worse than white associates, and in some respects, considerably better. The slights and oversights that he alleged at trial were “business as usual mismanagement.” And the extra efforts that the firm made to keep Mungen were evidence of a commitment to equal opportunity. By contrast, critics, including Barrett, saw Mungen’s story as a textbook case of “a reckless indifferent affirmative action.” From their vantage, the firm’s efforts were too little too late. Unsurprisingly, these competing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page40" class="pagebreak" title="40">40</span>perceptions usually divided along racial lines and typified attitudes within the profession generally. In an ABA survey around the time, only 8 percent of black lawyers, but 41 percent of whites, believed that firms had a genuine commitment to diversity.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.144" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.144" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Much, of course, depends on what counts as commitment. Katten’s management, like that at many firms, undoubtedly did want lawyers of color to succeed. Even from a purely pragmatic standpoint, it helps in recruitment and business development if a firm includes more than the single black lawyer that Katten’s Washington office had during Mungen’s employment. But while many attorneys want to achieve greater diversity, they do not necessarily want to rethink the structures that get in the way. </p>

In defense of the firm’s reputation, one partner suggested that the lawyer who had made the offensive remarks was “equal opportunity rude and nasty.” Eleven openly gay partners issued a public statement rejecting any suggestion that the firm fostered a hostile environment. Charney’s response was: “It’s totally unclear to me how somebody who has never met me could suggest that because we sit in the same building and he’s in an environment that he’s happy in, that that is any way reflective of what’s happening in my environment.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.146" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.146" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How would you have responded if you were on the firm’s management committee? Should firms do more to sanction “equal opportunity offenders?” </p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The ABA’s Presidential Initiative Commission on Diversity and the Commission on Women in the Profession, together with other experts in the field, have issued a broad set of recommendations to promote diversity and inclusion within the profession.

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> For example, employers should intensify their efforts in hiring, retaining, and promoting lawyers of color. In particular, employers should reassess evaluation procedures and criteria that have a disproportionate racial </span>

Recruiters should make greater contact with law schools that have substantial minority enrollments, either through onsite interviews or letters to minority student associations and visits to regional minority placement conferences. Hiring standards should avoid excessive reliance on first-year grades, LSAT scores, and law review experience, which disproportionately exclude students of color and do not measure the full range of skills that are necessary for successful practice. After reviewing research on lawyer effectiveness, Bill Henderson concludes that “academic factors are not very reliable proxies for future lawyering potential.”</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> Other metrics, including some standard personal questionnaires and tailored structured interviews, are better at assessing factors such as achievement motivation and self-discipline, which are more valid predictors of workplace performance.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Employers should also review their evaluation, mentoring, and compensation procedures to assess their impact on underrepresented groups.

Providing adequate opportunities for supervisory experiences, client contact, and transfer of client business should be key priorities. Work/family policies should ensure access to flexible and reduced schedules without career costs. Mentoring, training, and affinity groups focused on the needs of LGBTQ lawyers are also critical, as is support for pro bono work around issues of sexual orientation, and monitoring of initiatives to ensure that they are in fact securing an inclusive culture.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.151" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.151" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span> Compensation systems should be evaluated to prevent systematic gender bias in the allocation of credit for originating business and evaluating performance. </p>

The client’s legal needs were not in an area where she had substantive expertise, although a colleague pointed out that she had worked for the Department of Transportation while a law student and the client’s business was shipping. But business was slow and she felt enormous pressure to respond as she did. “No problem. . . . You know I’m always willing to help with anything that will be good for the firm.” She later regretted the decision. At the meeting when her colleague “made the pitch about the firm’s relevant expertise, none of which I possessed, it was clear that the only reason I was there was to tout the firm’s diversity, which was practically nonexistent. In that moment, I wanted to fling myself through the plate glass window of that well-appointed conference room overlooking the port of Oakland.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.153" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> Would you have felt the same?

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In an effort to address in-court disparities, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein has recently issued new rules to govern his courtroom. One states that “junior members of legal teams” are “invited to argue motions they have helped prepare and to question witnesses with whom they have worked.” Judge Weinstein further notes that he is “amenable to permitting a number of lawyers to argue for one party if this creates an opportunity for a junior lawyer to participate” and clarifies that the rule was prompted by “studies of underrepresentation of female attorneys and minorities.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.154" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.154" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span> What is your view of Judge Weinstein’s approach?

Named after Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to the American bar in 1869, the rule requires that firms consider diverse candidates for at least 30 percent of open leadership and governance roles.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.155" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span> Do you believe that legal employers should adopt the Mansfield rule?

      <p class="TextParagraph">In 2016, the ABA adopted a new subsection to Rule 8.4<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4&quot; \s &quot;Rule 8.4&quot; \c 16 " />. As amended, Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4(g)&quot; \s &quot;8.4(g)&quot; \c 16 " />8.4(g) provides: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . (g) engage in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, or socioeconomic status in conduct related to the practice of law. This paragraph does not limit the ability of a lawyer to accept, decline or withdraw from a representation. </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">As of December 2019, only two jurisdictions had adopted that rule, although about half had some anti-discriminatory language in their rule or comments.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.159" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.159" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 8.4’s revision reflects a quarter century of efforts to obtain an explicit antidiscrimination prohibition. The ABA rejected efforts in 1992 and 1994, and, in 1998, it enacted a compromise provision in the Comments that stated: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[3]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer who, in the course of representing a client, knowingly manifests by words or conduct, bias or prejudice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" class="pagebreak" title="44">44</span>based upon race, sex, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status, violates [the Rule] when such actions are prejudicial to the administration of justice. Legitimate advocacy respecting the foregoing factors does not violate [the Rule]. A trial judge’s finding that peremptory challenges were exercised on a discriminatory basis does not alone establish a violation of this rule.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, as an ABA Report accompanying the 2016 Rule change noted, many lawyers viewed this Comment as inadequate because it did not have the same authority as a Rule and applied only to conduct occurring in the course of representing a client that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.160" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.160" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span> The new Rule 8.4(g)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(g)&quot; " /> is broader. It extends protection to three new categories: ethnicity, marital status and gender identity. Furthermore, a <span style="font-style: italic;">new</span> Comment 3 defines “harassment” to include “derogatory or demeaning verbal or physical conduct,” while a new Comment 4 provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[4]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Conduct related to the practice of law includes representing clients; interacting with witnesses, coworkers, court personnel, lawyers and other while engaged in the practice of law; operating or managing a law firm or law practice, and participating in bar association, business or social activities in connection with the practice of law. Lawyers may engage in conduct undertaken to promote diversity and inclusion without violating this rule, by, for example, implementing initiatives aimed at recruiting, hiring, retaining and advancing diverse employees or sponsoring diverse law student organizations. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although Rule 8.4(g)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(g)&quot; " /> passed by voice vote in the ABA House of Delegates, and no one spoke in opposition, there were considerable concerns expressed in writing, especially in states that considered adoption. Many of these reservations centered on First Amendment concerns. For example, the Texas Attorney General maintained that Rule 8.4(g) “would severely restrict attorney’s ability to engage in meaningful debate on a range of important social and political issues,” including illegal immigration, same-sex marriage, or bathroom usage, and would suppress “thoughtful and complete exchanges about these complex issues.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.161" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span> Professor Eugene Volokh, in a letter to the Arizona Supreme Court, agreed and claimed that Rule 8.4(g) would “turn ordinary employment disputes into disciplinary matters,” and enable disgruntled employees to “use the express or implied threat of a bar complaint as leverage to favorably settle even a meritless lawsuit.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.162" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.162" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Others, meanwhile, insist that Rule 8.4(g)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(g)&quot; " /> violates the First Amendment on the theory that it imposes content-based restrictions on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" class="pagebreak" title="45">45</span>lawyers’ speech.

      <p class="TextParagraph">By contrast, other critics argue that Rule 8.4(g) is likely to have little effect.

      <p class="TextParagraph">In the summer of 2017, many in the legal and leadership community read with shock a front page article in the Sunday <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> business section. The author, Eilene Zimmerman, movingly described the death of her ex-husband, Peter, from an infection related to drug abuse. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" class="pagebreak" title="47">47</span>Peter Zimmerman was a leading partner at a leading Silicon Valley law firm who, for several years, had exhibited signs of serious ill health and substance abuse. It is, of course no secret that many highly successful lawyers suffer from such problems. But what the article brought home is just how serious and tragic their difficulties may be when others look away, or fail to look at all. Eilene Zimmerman writes: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Of all the heartbreaking details of his story, the one that continues to haunt me is this: The history on his cellphone shows the last call he ever made was for work. Peer, vomiting, unable to sit up, slipping in and out of consciousness, had managed, somehow, to dial into a conference call.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . . Peter Zimmerman’s case is all too typical. The most comprehensive recent study of lawyers and substance abuse . . . was cosponsored by the American Bar Association and Hazelden Foundation. Based on responses from almost 13,000 attorneys, it found that about a fifth of lawyers (21 percent) qualify as problem drinkers and suffer from anxiety (19 percent), and over a quarter struggle with mild or more serious depression (28 percent). Figures on drug use are unreliable because three-quarters of the survey participants declined to answer . . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The limited research available also suggests that lawyers report almost three times the rate of depression and almost twice the rate of substance abuse as other Americans. Law ranks among the top five careers for suicide. Primary reasons for legal professionals’ particular vulnerability . . . . [involve stresses of practice that] set lawyers up for an array of health-related concerns. . . . For lawyers in firms, billable hours have sharply escalated, and what has not changed is the number of hours in the day. Law is the nation’s second most sleep deprived occupation, which escalates the risk of anxiety and depression, and seriously impairs performance. All work and no play is increasingly the norm and, as a<span style="font-style: italic;"> New Yorker </span>cartoon notes, it “makes you a valued employee.” . . . Unsurprisingly most surveyed lawyers report that they do not have sufficient time for themselves and their families, and overwork is a leading cause of lawyers’ physical and psychological health difficulties. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addressing these issues, technology has created as many problems as it has solved. Electronic communication has made it increasingly possible for lawyers to work at home or on vacation, but has also made it increasingly impossible for them not to do so. Lawyers remain tethered to their devices, as Eilene Zimmerman notes in describing Peter’s memorial service. When a young associate from the firm “stood up to speak of their friendship . . . [q]uite a few of the lawyers attending the service were bent over their phones, reading and tapping out emails. Their friend and colleague was dead, and yet they couldn’t stop working long enough to listen to what was being said about him.” </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Racial, ethnic, gender, and class bias also creates additional stress. Underrepresented groups often face isolation, denigration, harassment, and pressures to suppress aspects of their identity to fit the dominant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" class="pagebreak" title="48">48</span>culture. Chronic “micro-inequities”—subtle insults, denigrating messages, and patterns of being overlooked, and undervalued—can impair performance and psychological wellbeing. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Although increasing numbers of legal employers have responded with some wellness programs, and data are lacking on their effectiveness], the experience in other fields is not especially encouraging. All too often employers supply voluntary opportunities with or without modest incentives for participation, which do not attract most employees or address the root causes of stress (such as overwork, inflexible and predictable schedules, excessive competition and unrealistic time pressure). Failure to modify these conditions is not only inhumane, it is economically unproductive; bleary, burned out, disaffected and/or addicted lawyers are not delivering cost effective services. Leaders need to know more about how their policies and practices are exacerbating rather than combatting the problem. </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How should the profession address these issues in different sectors of the profession including law schools, law firms, and bar associations? What strategies are most promising and what obstacles stand in the way? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The ABA has cosponsored a National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being that has provided over forty-four specific recommendations for legal employers, legal educators, bar regulators, and other stakeholders.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.173" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.173" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">142</a></span> The proposals that have gotten the most traction focus on providing education and confidential access to resources for attorneys facing these challenges.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.174" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.174" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">143</a></span> There is, however, little evidence of a commitment to reducing the problems of overwork and inflexible schedules that compromise well-being. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In a recent survey of law firm leaders, the majority saw stress and workload as the main drivers of mental health and substance abuse difficulties.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.175" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.175" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">144</a></span> Other research finds that lawyers are the second most sleep-deprived professionals in the U.S., and that fatigue can compromise judgment and decisionmaking.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.176" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.176" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">145</a></span> Addressing these issues can, of course, be a tough sell to employers whose business model is built on long hours and constant availability. But lawyer impairment threatens these goals; stress and overwork are leading major contributors to physical and psychological <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" class="pagebreak" title="49">49</span>problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.177" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.177" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">146</a></span> What can and should the profession do to respond to the causes not simply the symptoms of impairment? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">That same survey found that, although 94 percent of law firm leaders believed that addiction to alcohol and drugs was stigmatized, 87 percent thought that getting treatment for addiction is not.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.178" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.178" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">147</a></span> If those beliefs are accurate, what can leaders do to encourage more lawyers to obtain treatment? What can the profession do to help address stress in times of crisis, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.179" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section12.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.179" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">148</a></span></p>
