        <span style="color: 000;">Introduction</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A course on legal ethics is unique in many ways, but the most prominent is its relevance to all areas of practice. Every lawyer, in every practice specialty, confronts issues of professional responsibility and professional role. The daily life of most attorneys involves often undramatic but important ethical choices about relationships with clients, colleagues, adversaries, judges, governmental officials, and “the law.” This book explores how lawyers forge their professional identities. Its analysis proceeds on two levels. The first concerns issues of personal responsibility; attention centers on the innumerable individual choices that define the kind of lawyers we become, as well as the legal standards that justify or challenge those choices. A second set of issues involves collective responsibilities shared by all members of the bar. These issues often implicate broader questions of social justice. Examples include access to legal services, the bar’s regulatory structure, and the impact of ethical standards on the profession and the public.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The “law of lawyering”—the codes of conduct and the other bodies of law governing legal practice—structures but by no means limits our analysis. Lawyers’ professional identities are shaped by a vastly more complex set of values and pressures than those captured in codified rules. For that reason, this textbook takes the law of lawyering as its point of departure but not its only guide. The subject also requires attention to the conditions of practice—to the situational constraints and moral ideals that guide their activities. Our aim is to provide a wide array of materials—drawing not only from law, but also from history, philosophy, psychology, economics, and sociology—that will place questions of professional identity in broader context.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the most striking changes in the legal world over the past three decades has been the increasing attention to professional responsibility and regulation. Issues concerning the ethics of lawyers and the distribution of legal services have become matters of broad concern, both within and outside the profession. Since the 1980s, the law of lawyering has developed at an explosive rate; empirical research has expanded at a corresponding speed; and the philosophical underpinnings of professional roles have attracted more searching examination.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These developments underscore a final sense in which courses in legal ethics are distinctive. They concern lawyers’ conduct, choices and values. Partly for that reason, this book centers on problems, together with discussion notes and questions. Yet the issues raised in these materials are rarely simply hypothetical; they draw on experiences from reported cases, empirical research, personal interviews, and journalistic as well as scholarly publications. They involve real lives and real <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page2" class="pagebreak" title="2">2</span>consequences. Furthermore, notwithstanding the codified rules of professional conduct, the subject involves many fundamental unanswered questions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is, of course, far easier to take the “moral high road” in class than in life—even when the high road is obvious. This book, however, focuses primarily on contexts where the most appropriate course of conduct is not self-evident. Our attention centers not on issues as straightforward as maintaining a separate bank account for client funds but on areas where there are strong competing values or unresolved doctrinal and policy issues at stake. While many of the problems that follow do not have determinate answers, the materials can suggest better and worse ways of analyzing the right questions. Before addressing these problems, however, it is helpful to focus on certain assumptions about the subject of legal ethics.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc335223359" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732149" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733148" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369091" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486707" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861183" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922215" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218773" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908198" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What Is the “Ethics” in Legal Ethics?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In one sense, the term “legal ethics” refers narrowly to the system of professional regulations governing the conduct of lawyers—the subject-matter tested by the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE). In a broader sense, however, legal ethics is a special case of ethics as understood in the central traditions of philosophy and religion. From this broader perspective, legal ethics cuts more deeply than legal regulation: It concerns the moral aspects of our lives as lawyers. As Socrates noted, the subject of ethics “is not about just any question, but about the way one should live.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An organizing premise of this book is that these two aspects of legal ethics cannot be separated. The study of codified ethical rules apart from broader ethical principles makes no sense; a code of professional conduct that ignored the moral commitments of those it governed would be doomed to irrelevance. On the other hand, an abstract study of legal ethics unconnected to the institutional and doctrinal basis of law practice would be equally ineffective. Our aim is to integrate both dimensions of analysis.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The study of legal regulations is a familiar part of the law school curriculum; to a certain extent, it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the law school curriculum. On the other hand, the study of ethics in the sense Socrates defined it forms the subject matter of moral philosophy, a discipline in which many lawyers, law students, and law teachers lack extended training. However, for our purposes, no such background is necessary: Most academic moral philosophy concerns theoretical issues that have little direct bearing on legal ethics, even in the broad, Socratic sense. </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page3" class="pagebreak" title="3">3</span>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861184" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218774" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756187" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908318" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Distinction Between Ethics and Morality</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An obvious threshold issue is what exactly is ethics and whether it differs from morality. In everyday conversation, the terms sometimes carry different connotations. When we call lawyers or other professionals “unethical,” we usually mean that they have been somehow dishonest—that they have lied, cheated, or become involved in a conflict of interest. By contrast, calling a person “immoral” may conjure up an image of depravity—of cruelty, sexual misconduct, or otherwise illicit behavior. Moral philosophers, however, do not generally use the words “ethics” and “morality” in these restrictive senses, and this book uses them interchangeably.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This is not to imply that the terms have always been interchangeable. Some theorists, including the prominent nineteenth century German philosopher Hegel, have reserved the word “ethics” to refer to the customary norms within a specific society—the society’s <span style="font-style: italic;">ethos</span>.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> The term “morality,” on the other hand, is often used to refer to philosophical systems involving abstract universal norms of right and wrong.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.3" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span> Immanuel Kant’s famous “categorical imperative”—“act so that you treat humanity . . . always as an end, and never as a means only”—is an example of such a universal moral principle.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.4" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> The categorical imperative, Kant believed, is valid at all times and in all cultures, and he offered a general argument for its truth.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This distinction between theory-based morality and custom-based ethics suggests a sharp separation between everyday judgments and philosophical theories. In fact, philosophical theories of morality generally reflect and reinforce strands of the culture’s dominant ethical norms and common-sense understandings. For example, Kant’s categorical imperative has two distinctive prescriptions, neither of which is peculiar to his philosophical system. First, Kant insists that the moral law applies to everyone: it speaks of “humanity” in general. Second, Kant instructs us to treat others as ends and not merely as means. The first injunction—to treat everyone, including those of other races, nationalities, or religions, with full moral consideration—is hardly an invention of academic philosophers. Similarly, in everyday life we often criticize people for “using” others merely as means to an end. What is distinctively philosophical about Kant’s approach is not its core moral insights, but the extended argument on which they are grounded. Because philosophical moral theories such as Kant’s overlap with customary ethical traditions (secular as well as religious), no general distinction between ethics and morality seems helpful.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" class="pagebreak" title="4">4</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There is, however, an important difference between accepting customary ethical beliefs on faith and subjecting them to critical reflection. Positive morality refers to the dominant moral traditions in a particular society. Critical morality involves a systematic examination of those traditions to determine whether they should be obeyed, modified, or abandoned. One of the most important functions of legal ethics is to offer critical scrutiny of the positive morality of legal practice. In the chapters that follow, conventional norms such as those regarding client loyalty, confidentiality, and access to legal services are subject to such reflection.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861185" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218775" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756188" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908319" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Moral Relativism</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A related set of questions has to do with the basis of moral judgment. Values differ significantly within and across particular societies. From this fact, moral relativists argue that ethics are not universal, but rather relative to individuals or cultures.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.5" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> In its extreme form, relativism denies the possibility of generalizable moral judgments. This position is often rooted in healthy instincts of tolerance and humility. “Judge not, lest you be judged” counsels appropriate restraint in contexts of moral complexity.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.6" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet almost no one—even those who claim to be relativists—accepts relativism in its most extreme form. If someone steals our property or betrays our friendship, it is natural to feel outraged. But pursued to its logical extreme, relativism can condemn such practices only if they violate the relativist’s own standards; and the relativist will have to concede that the thief or the treacherous friend may be justified according to his or her own standards. To find an action repugnant while insisting that others can justifiably pursue it is a feat that few of us are willing or able to perform.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Suppose, for example, that someone you regard as a close friend has taken your work and claimed it as his own, or has blamed you for dishonest acts that he committed. A true relativist would have to acknowledge that “I think it’s wrong, but maybe from his point of view what he did was justified. Who am I to say?” If such a response seems unsatisfying, that should tip us off that something is wrong with relativism. There is, moreover, an internal contradiction in relativists’ claim that because no universal moral standards exist, it is wrong to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page5" class="pagebreak" title="5">5</span>impose one’s own values. If there are no universal principles, by what criteria does the relativist claim that moral praise or blame are “wrong”?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Moreover, moral convictions are often less indeterminate than is commonly supposed. Those who engage in reflective decisionmaking frequently come to share certain basic moral premises. Given full information and an opportunity for dispassionate and disinterested judgment, individuals appear likely to agree about certain essential values, such as honesty, loyalty, benevolence, and avoidance of unnecessary harm. Some biologists and neuroscientists believe that certain moral dispositions and emotions have been adaptive for survival and are now hard wired into the brain.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.7" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> All known societies agree on many basic moral judgments, for example that doing a bad thing intentionally is worse than doing it by accident.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.8" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course, disagreements often arise about how to apply broadly shared values or resolve conflicts between them in particular cases. However, much of the controversy surrounding moral issues involves disputes about facts, not principles. The same is true of most of the hotly contested questions of legal ethics. Lawyers disagree about exceptions to the duty of confidentiality not because they disagree about what values are important but because they disagree about what rules would best serve those values. Would requiring lawyers to disclose certain confidential information to protect third parties significantly erode client trust and candor? In the long run, would imposing greater disclosure obligations put lawyers in a position to prevent more or less harm?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Thus, we can remain sensitive to the dangers of moral arrogance without abandoning moral convictions. We can also sometimes acknowledge uncertainty about our moral judgments, particularly when the issues are complex or controversial. We can, however, attempt to think the matter through honestly, to consider opposing views, and to make allowances for influences that might distort our judgment. And why ask for more? We must often make decisions in the face of factual uncertainty, yet this does not make us relativists about facts. When we face a moral decision, we have no choice but to do what seems right to us, even though we recognize that we could be mistaken. After all, the alternative to acting on the judgment that seems best is acting on a judgment that seems worse.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page6" class="pagebreak" title="6">6</span>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218776" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756189" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908320" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ethics and Law</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To some students, legal ethics seems vague or “squishy,” while legal rules seem comparatively clear and determinate. From this perspective, it seems preferable to focus only on the law of lawyering. Yet as every skilled lawyer knows, legal rules are often complex and ambiguous. What constitutes a “reasonable person,” an appropriate business judgment, or the right balance between competing constitutional values? The complexity and indeterminacy of moral judgments is no greater than that of corresponding legal judgments.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This is not to deny that there are “easy cases” in law (as indeed there are in ethics), and that at times the law of lawyering may apparently settle an issue and thereby remove it from the realm of conscience and discretion. Yet even in cases that are clearly covered by formal ethics rules or other law, moral issues inevitably remain.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">First, and most fundamentally, there is always the question whether to accept a client’s case. Second is the question of how, and by what means, to pursue it. On those (hopefully rare) occasions when settled legal rules clearly demand a course of action that the lawyer finds morally repugnant, serious soul-searching is necessary. To dismiss the issue simply because the law permits a course of action is a rationalization, not a reason, for decision. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In any event, many of the formal ethics rules leave the ultimate decision to the lawyer’s discretion. Thus, for example, the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct permit, but do not require, a lawyer to reveal confidential client information “to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.9" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> Bar ethical rules permit, but do not require, a corporate lawyer to reveal confidences if the corporation’s highest authority insists on violating the law in a way that is likely to injure the corporation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.10" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.10" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> They permit, but do not require, a lawyer to decline or withdraw from representation if the client insists on taking an action that the lawyer finds “repugnant.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.11" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.11" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> They permit, but do not require, lawyers to include “moral, economic, social and political factors” in the advice they offer clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.12" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.12" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> They recommend, but do not require, that lawyers perform fifty hours annually of pro bono service.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.13" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.13" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> For these as well as many other issues that arise in legal practice, the law itself invites lawyers to consider their own moral values.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861187" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218777" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756190" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908321" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Moral Theories</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A basic understanding of the primary frameworks of moral philosophy can sometimes be helpful in addressing the ethical issues that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page7" class="pagebreak" title="7">7</span>arise in legal practice. In essence, moral philosophy is concerned with what makes an action right or wrong. That inquiry has given rise to three basic approaches: those that focus on the consequences of the action; those that emphasize the action itself; and those that center on the character of the actor.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Consequentialism</span> judges the rightness or wrongness of actions based on their consequences. The most familiar consequentialist theory is <span style="font-style: italic;">utilitarianism</span>, primarily as developed by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.14" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.14" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> In its most familiar form, utilitarianism evaluates actions on the basis of the happiness or welfare they create or the harm they inflict: utilitarians attempt to sum up these consequences, and recommend the action that creates the “greatest good for the greatest number.” From this perspective, an individual’s moral obligation is to choose a course of action that maximizes utility, or at least surpasses some threshold of utility.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Such approaches have two major limitations. One involves indeterminacy: it will often be extremely difficult to predict and weigh how one’s actions affect aggregate welfare. A second limitation is that, because consequentialists simply add together the gains and losses of society’s members, they can justify policies that benefit the many at the expense of the few. For this reason, critics often object that consequentialism cannot safeguard minority rights and is insensitive to the distribution of harms and benefits, a deficiency that other ethical theories seek to address.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Contemporary theories of consequentialism attempt to meet these and other objections with modifications and adjustments of the theory. One result is that today’s philosophical literature on consequentialism is often complex and technical.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.15" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.15" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> For our purposes, the most important points to keep in mind are simply (a) that moral consequences matter and (b) there are reasons to think that consequences may not be the only thing that matters.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other theories are act-centered rather than consequence-centered. They are usually labeled <span style="font-style: italic;">deontological</span>, a term derived from the Greek word for duty. Some actions may be right or wrong, permitted or forbidden, regardless of their consequences. Therefore it may be our duty to avoid wrong and do right, no matter what the consequences.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In a famous passage in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span>, one of Dostoyevsky’s characters poses this challenge:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" class="pagebreak" title="8">8</span>and rest at last. Imagine that you are doing this but that it is essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature—that child beating its breast with its fist, for instance—in order to found that edifice on its unavenged tears. Would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me. Tell me the truth.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.16" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.16" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">For a utilitarian, this question is easy: To achieve happiness for millions of individuals one would of course torture a single child. But perhaps there is something suspect about a theory that makes this an easy question. There is much to be said for the principle that intentionally inflicting suffering on the innocent is wrong regardless of the consequences.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative forbids us from using other individuals as a mere means, no matter how compelling the end. Kant, the best-known deontological philosopher, focused heavily on our duty to follow the categorical imperative.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.17" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> Duties lend themselves to codified rules, and in many countries codes of professional ethics are referred to as “deontologies.” Among contemporary deontologists, however, the focus has shifted from an emphasis on moral duties to an emphasis on moral rights. A modern proponent of deontological approaches would argue that the innocent child in Dostoyevsky’s fable has a moral right not to be tortured—an entitlement that overrides the gain in utility to humanity at large. In the words of philosopher Ronald Dworkin, rights “trump” utility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.18" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.18" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course, there is plenty of room for debate about what our moral rights are. Moreover, in defining the scope of moral rights, it may be important to take account of consequences. Thus, it is most accurate to think of deontology as a family of theories rather than as a single theory, which all rest on the view that consequences are not determinative.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A third group of theories are generally lumped together under the label <span style="font-style: italic;">virtue ethics</span>. These theories focus on the character or virtue of the actor, rather than on the nature of the act or on its consequences. Aristotle’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Nicomachaean </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Ethics</span> offered the first systematic expression of this approach. He focused on character and stressed the importance of certain key virtues, such as honesty, courage, temperance, and justice, along with the intellectual virtue of practical wisdom. In the Middle Ages, Christian moralists followed Aristotle’s approach, although they also recognized certain virtues, such as mercy, that were quite foreign to Greek thought. A number of contemporary legal ethicists have attempted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" class="pagebreak" title="9">9</span>to revive the Aristotelian tradition and have insisted that the most important questions of ethics concern character.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.19" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span> In their view, it is important to focus on the development of individual moral judgment, rather than the reduction of morality to impersonal rules.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.20" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.20" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To focus on virtue in legal ethics is to shift emphasis from the nature of particular actions and their consequences to the character of the lawyers who perform these actions. Under this approach, conduct is subject to praise or condemnation primarily on the grounds of what it reflects about the person; acts may be dishonest or forthright, extortionate or generous, disloyal or decent. Virtue ethicists point out that someone uncertain of the virtuous course of action might get more guidance from looking at a trusted ethical role model than from the principle of utility or the categorical imperative.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.21" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span> Of course, even a virtuous lawyer can be perplexed about how to strike the right balance between competing values. Nor is a unified concept of character consistent with much contemporary research in psychology, neuroscience, and organizational behavior, which documents the situational nature of moral conduct and the extent to which contextual pressures can undermine individuals’ ethical commitments.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.22" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.22" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to such research, neither reason nor intuition always guides individuals to the most ethical course of action.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.23" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.23" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> In the words of Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, “thinking slow” and “thinking fast” both have their place.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.24" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>In some instances, reason allows us to step back and consider long-term consequences of impulsive self-interested behavior; in other contexts, it provides an opportunity to rationalize behavior that our initial instinct tells us is wrong. Such research indicates the need for lawyers to recognize their own moral fallibility and susceptibility to self-interest, and to build in triggers for internal and external checks on their conduct.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">All of these approaches have something to recommend them; all are subject to significant limitations. To choose among them, it is helpful to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page10" class="pagebreak" title="10">10</span>reflect on what would make them useful under particular circumstances. The eminent philosopher John Rawls suggested that a moral theory should be tested against our “considered moral judgments”: those we would make on reflection, but before we begin to theorize. A useful moral framework offers principles that accommodate our considered moral judgments. These principles can then help revise our judgments. Our judgments thus modified may then assist in further refining our principles, and so on. Eventually, Rawls suggests, we should arrive at a “reflective equilibrium” between principles and judgments, in which neither requires further adjustment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.25" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.25" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> This approach is consistent with recent work in cognitive psychology, which suggests that individuals generally arrive at moral decisions through intuitive responses, and then consider reasons that support or challenge their initial judgment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.26" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.26" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In practice, it may well be that different areas of our moral experience will fall into reflective equilibrium with different moral principles; some judgments may be best systematized by consequentialist theories, some by deontological theories, and some by theories of virtue. Cognitive psychology can also help reconcile our theoretical premises with moral practices. Although the objective of traditional philosophy was to produce unified theoretical frameworks, we have no reason to believe that our individual moral worlds are that tidy. According to many contemporary philosophers, our moral experience is, at its deepest level, <span style="font-style: italic;">pluralistic;</span> no single framework is adequate to encompass all aspects of our moral life. As Anthony Appiah puts it, “my philosophy is that everything is more complicated than you thought. . . . The messiness of ethics goes down deep.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.27" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.27" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> While we may look to moral theories for guidance, we still need to make intuitive judgments about which moral theory is most appropriate to the case at hand.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Throughout this book, we will be referring to Rules of Professional Conduct. Textbooks generally cite to the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and students are tested on the Model Rules in the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE). Indeed, accredited law schools are required to teach the Model Rules. Federal law grants the ABA accrediting authority over U.S. law schools, and the ABA has mandated that “A law school shall require all students in the J.D. program to receive . . . instruction in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct of the American Bar Association.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.28" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.28" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" class="pagebreak" title="11">11</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, the ABA has also copyrighted the Model Rules, and it does not grant permission to reproduce the Model Rules in the text without also reproducing the sometimes-lengthy comments in full; permission is also conditioned on payment of a substantial fee. We think this is not a good use of your money (additional casebook pages and fees mean additional cost), because the comments are readily available on the Internet.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Once a state adopts a Model Rule into its own law, the language incorporated into the state rule enters the public domain.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.29" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> As it happens, the State of Delaware adopted almost all the Model Rules and their comments verbatim as its own Rules of Professional Conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.30" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.30" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> Accordingly, in this book, except in a few cases when otherwise noted, all direct quotations from rule language are from the Delaware Rules of Professional Conduct. Whenever we quote from the Delaware Rules, it should be understood that the language is identical to the corresponding Model Rule. When we merely cite to a rule rather than quoting it, we will continue to cite to the Model Rules.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.31" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section11.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.31" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span></p>
