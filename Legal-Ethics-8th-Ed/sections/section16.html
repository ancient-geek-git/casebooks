      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the most central and at times contested requirements of a lawyer’s loyalty to clients is the duty of confidentiality. Many will at some point confront troubling dilemmas involving client confidentiality. For example, criminal defense lawyers may believe that their clients committed a crime for which someone else is about to be sentenced. A client may ask a lawyer to negotiate a contract without revealing to opposing parties that they are bargaining under a material misapprehension.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.612" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.612" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> A litigator may know of the existence of a “smoking gun” that may not be within the scope of the adversary’s discovery request. Lawyers representing family members may learn secrets that one member of the family is keeping from the others.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.613" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.613" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> Corporate lawyers may learn that their clients are marketing products that could cause life-threatening injuries.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.614" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.614" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Distinction Between the Duty of Confidentiality and the Attorney-Client Privilege</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Confidentiality rules that speak to these dilemmas arise from two main sources: laws of evidence concerning the attorney-client privilege and bar ethical codes that specifically govern confidentiality. <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">Though they are related, the attorney-client privilege and the ethical duty of confidentiality are not the same. The attorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence, which protects attorney-client communications from disclosure in a proceeding before a tribunal. By contrast, the much broader ethical duty of confidentiality forbids lawyers from divulging confidential information to anyone, not just to a tribunal. </span>In terms of coverage, the attorney-client privilege protects only confidential communications to or from a client. By contrast, the rule of confidentiality, enshrined in Rule 1.6, protects all “information relating to representation of a client.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.615" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.615" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">The rules governing the attorney-client privilege have been developed by courts and legislatures; the duty of </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" class="pagebreak" title="260">260</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">confidentiality, though nominally promulgated by the jurisdiction’s highest court, is in fact part of the bar’s professional rules. The attorney-client privilege is riddled with exceptions; the duty of confidentiality also has a few exceptions, but those exceptions are more narrowly drawn.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.616" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.616" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the materials that follow, we present the attorney-client privilege first, then the ethical duty of confidentiality. Section A lays out the doctrinal elements of the attorney-client privilege, and Section B discusses its rationale. Section C presents one of the principal exceptions to the privilege, the so-called crime-fraud exception. In Section D, discussion turns to the attorney-client privilege when the client is an organization rather than an individual. In Section E we turn to the work-product doctrine. Then, in Section F, we explore the ethical duty of confidentiality, and Section G addresses various limits on that duty. Finally, Section H presents two Problems to aid in your understanding of how the attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality interact.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The laws of evidence establishing an attorney-client privilege date back to the sixteenth century. In the classic formulation by John Wigmore, these laws provide:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.<a id="_Ref33194017" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.617" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.617" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The </span>
        <a id="dabmci_e2d3d9916b574d67a1ae48ab9d82d380" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> § 68</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> preserves the kernel of Wigmore’s analysis:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[T]he attorney-client privilege may be invoked . . . with respect to: (1) a communication (2) made by privileged persons (3) in confidence (4) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance for the client.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Each clause of these formulas gives rise to important questions. What kind of advice is “legal”? Who besides a lawyer is a “privileged person”? What is a “communication”? What determines whether the client has disclosed information in confidence? What counts as “disclosure”? Does it encompass disclosures of otherwise unprivileged <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page261" class="pagebreak" title="261">261</span>information from which privileged communications could be inferred? When is the privilege inadvertently waived? An extended body of law has evolved around these and other questions. Generally, this body of law suggests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element17" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Communication</span>. A “communication” can be in any form. Most client communications are via writing or speech, but the privilege also extends to communication through other mechanisms, such as telephone, email, text messages, and video recording. Further, the privilege extends to nonverbal communicative acts, such as facial expressions and bodily motions (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>., eye rolling or shrugging).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextHanging"><span id="Element18" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Privileged person</span>. A person is typically a “privileged person” if (a) the lawyer needs the person to be present and/or handle the privileged material in order to do her job or (b) the client needs the person to be present in order to communicate effectively with the lawyer or understand and act upon the lawyer’s advice. Thus, an interpreter or legal secretary is likely to be a “privileged person.” So is an accountant hired by the attorney to help the attorney understand the client’s financial information.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.618" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.618" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> Furthermore, a prospective client is a “privileged person,” as the privilege protects persons who communicate with a lawyer in an initial consultation but whom the lawyer does not thereafter represent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.619" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.619" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element19" /><span style="font-style: italic;">In confidence</span>. A communication is made “in confidence” if, at the time and in the circumstances of the communication, the communicating person reasonably believes that no one (save a “privileged person”) will learn the contents of the communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextHanging"><span id="Element20" /><span style="font-style: italic;">For the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance for the client</span>. In order for the privilege to attach, the client (or prospective client) must have consulted the lawyer to obtain legal counseling or advice, document preparation assistance, litigation services, or any other assistance customarily performed by lawyers in their professional capacity. So, for example, if a lawyer talks to a friend in confidence about a non-legal matter, the privilege does not attach.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.620" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.620" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A parallel body of law has evolved around the related work-product privilege, which protects material prepared for litigation except on a showing of necessity by a third party; this privilege is discussed below in Section E.</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page262" class="pagebreak" title="262">262</span>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861353" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218918" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756334" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908466" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Waiver</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the most significant areas of development involves waivers. Waiver is so important because, o</span>nce the privilege attaches, it can be waived if the client, the client’s lawyer, or another authorized agent of the client voluntarily discloses the communication to a non-privileged person. This waiver may be intentional or inadvertent. <span style="color: #000000;">The privilege will presumptively be waived if: the client and lawyer fail to assert the privilege; the client or her agent (including her lawyer) intentionally discloses the communication to an unprivileged third party (</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">e</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">g</span><span style="color: #000000;">., a close friend); or the client or her agent implicitly or explicitly consents to disclosure.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.621" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.621" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> Related principles deny any protection between co-clients of the same lawyer in the same matter: thus, no privilege applies in subsequent litigation between co-clients. On the other hand, a co-client generally cannot unilaterally waive the privilege relative to third parties, without first securing the consent of the other co-clients.</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">One court has observed that waiver is a “loose and misleading label for what is in fact a collection of different problems,” and explains:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Cases under this “waiver” heading include situations as divergent as an express and voluntary surrender of the privilege, partial disclosure of a privileged document, selective disclosure to some outsiders but not all, and inadvertent overhearings or disclosures.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.622" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.622" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What if a lawyer inadvertently discloses a privileged communication to an adversary, for example by mistakenly turning over a privileged document during discovery? As Chapter 4, Problem 1 indicated, lawyers disagree about the ethical obligations of the lawyer who receives the privileged information; courts similarly differ over whether inadvertent disclosure waives the privilege. Most but not all recent decisions </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">preserve</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the privilege in the face of accidental disclosure, and the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> § 79 agrees. For its part, </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Federal Rule of Evidence, Rule 502</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> focuses on reasonableness.

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What are “reasonable steps”? The advent of digital technology in legal practice over the past two decades greatly magnifies the danger of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page263" class="pagebreak" title="263">263</span>inadvertent disclosure, for example, through unencrypted email, file sharing, and inadequate redactions in e-discovery.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.624" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.624" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> The Model Rules now caution lawyers to keep abreast of new technologies,<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.625" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.625" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> and a 2017 ABA Formal Opinion explains that “reasonable efforts to protect against unauthorized disclosure in client communications thus includes analysis of security measures applied to both disclosure and access to a law firm’s technology system and transmissions.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.626" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.626" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To illustrate: In a 2017 case, a plaintiff insurance company’s counsel uploaded its own case files, with no password protection, into the same Box folder as discoverable documents. Counsel then mistakenly gave the adversary the URL to the entire Box folder in answer to a discovery request. Although the case files were clearly marked privileged and confidential, the judge found that plaintiff and counsel had not taken reasonable efforts to protect the files against disclosure, and the privilege was waived. In the judge’s words, plaintiff’s actions “were the cyber world equivalent of leaving its claims file on a bench in the public square and telling its counsel where they could find it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.627" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.627" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Particularly important in many cases of corporate misconduct is the issue of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">selective waiver</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. The issue arises because a company may wish to reveal privileged information to the government without waiving the privilege against a host of potential civil plaintiffs waiting in the wings.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Some government agencies, including the SEC, have taken the position that, in order to encourage full disclosure to regulators, organizations </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">should</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> be able to disclose information to the government, while retaining a privilege in subsequent suits by third parties. Courts, meanwhile, are divided—but most do not permit such selective waivers. In the view of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, “the investigatory agencies of the government should act to bring to light illegal activities,” not support “wrongdoers in concealing the information from the public domain.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.628" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.628" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Part of the concern is fairness to an adversary if partial revelation is allowed. As the Second Circuit has explained, “a party cannot partially disclose privileged communications or affirmatively rely on privileged communications to support its claim or defense and then shield the underlying communications from scrutiny.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.629" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.629" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> As courts often put it, once a party decides to waive the privilege on some </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page264" class="pagebreak" title="264">264</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">communications in order to use those communications as a “sword,” the party cannot use the privilege as a “shield” to protect similar information.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A related issue of selective waiver is whether waiving the privilege on one communication also waives the privilege on others. The issue figures in our next case. The governing federal standard is the following:</span>
      </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="dabmci_202448ef38c04abea5030d983271ca0e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756335" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908467" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product;<span> </span>Limitations on Waiver</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">When the disclosure is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a federal or state proceeding only if:</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">they ought in fairness to be considered together.</span>

      <p class="Center3emDash">———</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The case below considers this rule and another important issue—the distinction between privilege creation and privilege waiver—by examining whether the presence of third parties at an attorney-client conversation waives the privilege, or, alternatively, prevents it from forming in the first place.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Before turning to the decision, however, a little background on the case is helpful. This decision grows out of the massive Chevron-Ecuador litigation, <span style="color: #000000;">arguably the most complex and contentious environmental litigation of all time. The </span><span style="color: #000000;">case began in 1993, when a group of Ecuadoran peasants filed a class action lawsuit against Chevron. For two decades beginning in the 1960s, oil drilling by Texaco polluted the Lago Agrio area where the peasants lived. The pollution allegedly caused cancer in local residents as well as massive environmental devastation. Because Texaco was purchased by Chevron, Chevron became the defendant. After eighteen years of litigation, including removal of the case from the United States to Ecuador, the Ecuadoran court rendered an $18 billion judgment against Chevron, later reduced to $9.5 billion. </span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">However, Chevron accused plaintiffs’ lead counsel Steven Donziger of introducing fraudulent evidence, and also accused the Ecuadoran court of corruption. The company fought enforcement of the judgment in every </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">country where Chevron had assets; it took the Ecuadoran government before an international arbitration panel; and it sued Donziger under civil RICO. After eight more years of litigation, Chevron won all its cases; the Ecuadoran plaintiffs withdrew their last enforcement lawsuit in July 2019, twenty-six years after the litigation began.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">There were innumerable issues in the Lago Agrio litigation and they included issues of attorney-client privilege. In the RICO action against Donziger, Chevron’s counsel asserted the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege and successfully obtained discovery of his files. In addition, Chevron obtained outtakes and notes from a documentary filmmaker, whose film about the litigation, <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span>, allegedly included scenes of ongoing fraud that were later edited out. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The case below concerns Chevron’s efforts to obtain the allegedly privileged files of Kohn, Swift &amp; Graf, a law firm involved on the Ecuadoran plaintiffs’ side. Specifically, Joseph C. Kohn had been a contributing attorney and financier for sixteen years, from the inception of the initial class action in 1993 until Kohn had a falling out with Donziger in 2009.</p>

Kohn and his law firm, Kohn, Swift &amp; Graf, P.C. (KSG), pursuant to discovery applications that the Chevron applicants filed under <a id="dabmci_7a7bc139f33a4916a1122b263df6b8f7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />28 U.S.C. § 1782. <a id="dabmci_151d6e61c72042a98116f5a1dc22e925" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Section 1782 provides that “[t]he district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal,” subject to the express limitation that “[a] person may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing in violation of any legally applicable privilege.” <a id="dabmci_e7e1ecc1bf614773bfa97edf85cdb25e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />28 U.S.C. § 1782(a).</p>

The Chevron applicants sought <a id="dabmci_6e93205062bf40f1ab74bca006332f5a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />section 1782 discovery for use in the Lago Agrio litigation [as well as related matters]. . . . The Ecuadorian plaintiffs and the Republic of Ecuador (collectively “appellants”), both of whom intervened in the District Court in this case, contend that the Court erred in granting the Chevron applicants’ <a id="dabmci_fa918c86cb33449f9f874bd5e01c4d4c" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />section 1782 discovery applications and assert several challenges to the Court’s rulings. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page266" class="pagebreak" title="266">266</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The evidence the Chevron applicants presented in the District Court in support of their contentions came primarily from discovery that they obtained as a result of successful <a id="dabmci_33ce5804c3ff4836846ccbbd33f4171a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />section 1782 applications they filed in the Southern District of New York, particularly from outtakes during the production of <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span>, the documentary chronicling the Lago Agrio litigation. The outtakes were recordings made in the preparation of the final film that were not used in the documentary and were many times longer than the film itself. The Chevron applicants also introduced communications produced by Donziger, the lead American attorney for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs. . . . Kohn apparently was filmed for <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> on three occasions, during and after meetings in Philadelphia on April 10, 2006, June 5, 2006, and January 31, 2007. He appears in the released version of the documentary for less than 2 minutes, and, although we are not certain exactly how long he appears in the 600 hours of <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> outtakes, it is not a significant portion of that time, at least in a temporal sense, and, according to representations made at oral argument before us, likely was less than 2 hours.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Chevron suggests that Kohn’s file [to which they seek access] has communications related to its allegation that support its contention that [the $18 billion Ecuadorian judgment was procured by fraud]. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[The District Court ruled] that Donziger, in allowing the crew filming <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> intimate access to the proceedings in the Lago Agro litigation, effected a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege for all of Kohn’s communications related to that litigation. The Court also ruled that the Republic of Ecuador had failed to bear its burden of demonstrating the applicability of the community-of-interest doctrine. Because the Court granted the Chevron applicants discovery of all of Kohn’s communications related to the Lago Agrio litigation, it expressly declined to rule on the Chevron applicants’ contention that the crime-fraud exception operated to vitiate the attorney-client privilege. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The District Court reasoned as follows in reaching its conclusion that the filming of <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> effected a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege for all of Kohn’s communications relating to the Lago Agrio litigation:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[B]y inviting a documentary film crew to attend and record attorney meetings and other events where confidential matters were discussed, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs waived any otherwise applicable privilege or work-product protection for documents related to the Lago Agrio Litigation. The hundreds of hours of footage from the filming of <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> demonstrate that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs arranged for the filmmakers to attend numerous attorney meetings and gave them broad access to information that would usually be treated as a confidential part of the attorney-client relationship. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page267" class="pagebreak" title="267">267</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">The voluntary disclosure by a client of a privileged communication waives the privilege as to other such communications relating to the same subject matter made both prior to and after the occurrence of the waiver. Under some circumstances, a party making a very limited intentional disclosure is entitled to a fairness balancing test to determine if that the waiver extends to related documents. The Court concludes, however, that given the truly exceptional scope of the waiver in this case, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are not entitled to such a balancing test. To allow the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to waive [the] privilege expansively for favorable documents and information as part of a calculated public relations campaign and then shield related documents behind the screen of privilege would be to permit the use of privilege and the work product doctrine as both sword and shield, an abuse that courts have discouraged.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As we have indicated, the Ecuadorian appellants make the fundamental contention that “the presence of strangers” during attorney meetings precluded the attorney-client privilege from attaching to what otherwise might be privileged communications. If that contention is correct, then the communications in the presence of the filmmakers never were privileged and thus there could not have been, in the words of the District Court, a “voluntary disclosure by a client of a privileged communication” and the District Court necessarily erred in reaching its result. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Chevron applicants’ arguments, and the District Court’s opinion, presuppose that the attorney-client privilege protected the material in <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> and its outtakes from disclosure, for only if there was such a protection could the disclosure of that material waive the attorney-client privilege protecting Kohn’s file. Thus, our initial inquiry necessarily is whether the <span style="font-style: italic;">Crude</span> material was privileged in the first place. In order for the attorney-client privilege to attach to a communication, “it must be ‘(1) a communication (2) made between privileged persons (3) in confidence (4) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance for the client.<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span> <a id="dabmci_69c9d28917bf432bb31da32665d8cd8b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Teleglobe Commc’ns Corp., In re&quot; \s &quot;A;O;30;dabmci_69c9d28917bf432bb31da32665d8cd8b_1;I87e9b39c346a11dc962ef0ed15906072;;0;F;In re Teleglobe Commc’ns Corp., 493 F.3d 345, 359 (3d Cir. 2007)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">In re Teleglobe Commc’ns Corp.</span>, 493 F.3d 345, 359 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting <a id="dabmci_fca619023c4945d2b85e65395d283b4d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span> § 68 (2000)). We explained with respect to the third requirement in <a id="dabmci_c2160c2c303c450c89e6360f25209dd1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Teleglobe</span> that “if persons other than the client, its attorney, or their agents are present, the communication is not made in confidence, and the privilege does not attach.” Here, the communications captured on film clearly were not made “in confidence” due to the presence of the filmmakers at the time of the communications, and so the protections of the attorney-client privilege never attached to those communications. In such a scenario the waiver argument advanced by the Chevron applicants is unavailing because, inasmuch as the communications were not protected by the attorney-client privilege, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page268" class="pagebreak" title="268">268</span>there was no risk of a litigant using the privilege as both a sword and a shield in an effort to gain an advantage in litigation, and thus there is no role for a court to play as arbiter of notions of “fairness.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For that reason, we are constrained to reverse the District Court’s December 20, 2010 order granting the Chevron applicants’ application for discovery pursuant to <a id="dabmci_a09260b1d8ed4e0585dec66033ad4d3b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />section 1782. Because we will reverse the Court’s order granting the applications, it is not necessary for us to address most of the other issues the parties raise on this appeal, including the applicability of the community-of-interest doctrine, and we decline to offer our views with respect to those issues as they would be mere obiter dictum. . . . </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The “community-of-interest” (sometimes called “common interest”) doctrine referred to in the opinion is an exception to the doctrine of waiver. When parties to a litigation share a common interest, one party is allowed to share privileged information with attorneys for the other parties sharing the common interest without waiving the privilege. The Fourth Circuit has explained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Whether an action is ongoing or contemplated, whether the jointly interested persons are defendants or plaintiffs, and whether the litigation or potential litigation is civil or criminal, the rationale for the joint defense rule remains unchanged: persons who share a common interest in litigation should be able to communicate with their respective attorneys and with each other to more effectively prosecute or defend their claims.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.631" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.631" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Perhaps ironically, the fact that attorney-client conversations were carried out in the presence of third parties, rather than reported to them afterward—and were therefore unprivileged—preserved the attorney-client privilege for Kohn’s other attorney-client communications. Is that a rational result?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One category of information that has traditionally fallen outside the privilege involves basic information about the attorney-client relationship itself: the identity of the client, the size of the lawyer’s fee, the name of the person paying the fee if it is someone other than the client, and the fact that the attorney-client relationship exists. Furthermore, “matters existing in the public eye, such as a person’s appearance and handwriting, are generally not confidential communications because they were not exposed on the assumption that others would not learn of them.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.632" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.632" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In recent years, federal prosecutors have increasingly sought to subpoena attorneys in order to obtain such information. In particular, lawyers representing low-level participants in organized crime rings have been asked to reveal who is paying their fees and how much they are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page269" class="pagebreak" title="269">269</span>receiving. Such information can be useful in building a “net worth” case against organized crime bosses. (In a net worth case, the prosecution proves that the defendant has spent more money than his lawful sources of income can explain.)</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Defense counsel complain that prosecutors are also using these subpoenas for harassment—in an effort to drive a wedge between them and their clients. Rule 3.8(e), which sets forth the special responsibilities of a prosecutor, responds to that complaint. It takes the position that prosecutors should:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Does Rule 3.8(e) provide sufficient protection to criminal defendants?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Relying on the fact that the attorney-client privilege does not ordinarily protect client identity, courts have rejected claims of privilege to shield the names of clients who allegedly purchased illegal tax shelters.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.633" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.633" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> Do you agree that that information should not be privileged?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">One rarely-used exception to the general rule occurs when identifying the client would be tantamount to revealing otherwise-privileged additional information. In the leading case, <a id="dabmci_710435a623b6426799fdee7fca0a3f7d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Baird v.

Koerner</span>, 279 F.2d 623 (9th Cir. 1960), a group of taxpayers instructed their attorney to make an anonymous payment of back taxes, presumably to improve their position in any subsequent criminal investigation. The Ninth Circuit held that the clients’ identities were privileged, because to reveal their identities would be tantamount to revealing the privileged information that they owed back taxes. As the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> § 69 cmt. g explains: “The privilege applies if the testimony [about the client] directly or by reasonable inference would reveal the content of a confidential communication.”</p>

Instead, the DA subpoenas the attorney for purposes of obtaining information as to the client’s identity, and the attorney claims an attorney-client privilege. What results?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The rationale behind the attorney-client privilege is explicitly instrumental in character: Sealing the lawyer’s lips is a means of serving wider societal goals, not an end in itself. As McCormick summarizes it:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[T]he principal rationale of the privilege today rests upon three propositions. First the law is complex and in order for members of the society to comply with it in the management of their affairs and the settlement of their disputes they require the assistance of expert lawyers. Second, lawyers are unable to discharge this function without the fullest possible knowledge of the facts of the client’s situation. And last, the client cannot be expected to place the lawyer in full possession of the facts without the assurance that the lawyer cannot be compelled, over the client’s objection, to reveal the confidences in court. The consequent loss to justice of the power to bring all pertinent facts before the court is, according to the theory, outweighed by the benefits to justice (not to the individual client) of a franker disclosure in the lawyer’s office.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.634" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.634" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">This line of argument presumes that, without the privilege, candid disclosure from client to lawyer will be chilled; the adversary system will function less effectively, and societal interests in justice will be ill-served.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This justification for the privilege rests on the assumption that, without the assurance of confidentiality, clients would be unwilling to disclose compromising information to their lawyers. Is this assumption correct? Both public defenders and white-collar defenders report that clients are often unwilling to supply damaging facts even despite assurances of confidentiality. On the other hand, some defendants will tell their story to anyone with a seemingly sympathetic ear, even someone who will not be shielded by the privilege—police, cellmates, prison guards, or reporters.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Professor Fred Zacharias’s pioneering research on New York lawyers and clients produced a number of significant findings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element21" />Many of the lawyers he studied almost never informed their clients about the duty of confidentiality (and fewer than one in five informed their clients of confidentiality in the majority of cases);</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element22" />many of the clients misunderstood the nature and scope of confidentiality;</li>
      </ul>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page271" class="pagebreak" title="271">271</span>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element23" />only 30 percent of former clients said that they gave information to their lawyers that they would not have given without a guarantee of confidentiality; and</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element24" />only about half of the lay respondents predicted that they would withhold information without a guarantee of confidentiality.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.635" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.635" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextFlush">What accounts for these findings is not entirely clear. Perhaps confidentiality mattered to only 30 percent of the former clients because only 30 percent had sensitive information. Nevertheless, Zacharias’s survey raised questions about how often confidentiality is necessary and sufficient to avoid chilling client disclosures. A study of New Jersey lawyers found that the vast majority tell at least some of their clients about confidentiality. However, almost none inform their clients about the exceptions to confidentiality. Apparently, most lawyers fear that doing so will undermine the very trust they are trying to create.<a id="_Ref33194349" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.636" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.636" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Even granting the background assumptions about client candor, the instrumental argument for the privilege is not self-evidently correct. Jeremy Bentham’s famous and forceful critique suggests why. (Bentham, one of the founders of utilitarianism, was also a celebrated jurist.)</p>

      <p class="FileLine">302–04, 309–11 (Garland Publishing, Inc. 1978; reprint, 1827).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">English judges have taken care to exempt the professional members of the partnership from so unpleasant an obligation as that of rendering service to justice. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When, in consulting with a law adviser, attorney or advocate, a man has confessed his delinquency, or disclosed some fact which, if stated in court, might tend to operate in proof of it, such law adviser is not to be suffered to be examined as to any such point. The law adviser is neither to be compelled, nor so much as suffered, to betray the trust thus reposed in him. Not suffered? Why not? Oh, because to betray a trust is treachery; and an act of treachery is an immoral act.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An immoral sort of act, is that sort of act, the tendency of which is, in some way or other, to lessen the quantity of happiness in society. In what way does the supposed cause in question tend to the production of any such effect? The conviction and punishment of the defendant, he being guilty, is by the supposition an act the tendency of which, upon the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page272" class="pagebreak" title="272">272</span>whole, is beneficial to society. Such is the proposition which for this purpose must be assumed. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But if such confidence, when reposed, is permitted to be violated, and if this be known, (which, if such be the law, it will be), the consequence will be, that no such confidence will be reposed. Not reposed?—Well: and if it be not, wherein will consist the mischief? The man by the supposition is guilty; if not, by the supposition there is nothing to betray; let the law adviser say every thing he has heard, every thing he can have heard from his client, the client cannot have any thing to fear from it. That it will often happen that in the case supposed no such confidence will be reposed, is natural enough: the first thing the advocate or attorney will say to his client, will be,—Remember that, whatever you say to me, I shall be obliged to tell, if asked about it. What, then, will be the consequence? That a guilty person will not in general be able to derive quite so much assistance from his law adviser, in the way of concerting a false defence, as he may do at present. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Thus much as to the case where the effect of the disclosure may be to subject the client to suffer as for an offence. Where the effect of it does not go beyond the subjecting him to some non-penal obligation to which he otherwise might not be subjected, or to debar him from some right of which he otherwise might have come into possession, or remained possessed,—the objection is no more reconcilable with the main object of the law than in the other case. In every such case, though by a process grievously and unnecessarily dilatory and expensive, what the law does, or to be consistent ought to do, is to compel each party, out of his own mouth, (or, to speak literally, by his own hand), to make disclosure of such facts as, lying within his own knowledge, are of a nature to contribute towards substantiating the claim of the adversary. Can there be any reason why that information, which he is compelled to give by his own hand, should not be obtained with equal facility from another hand, from which, if there be any difference, it may be extracted with less reluctance?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Wigmore summarizes Bentham’s argument thus: “It always comes back to this, that the deterring of a guilty man from seeking legal advice is no harm to justice, while the innocent man has nothing to fear and therefore will not be deterred.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.637" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.637" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> How would you respond to this argument?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">One response is to question whether deterring a guilty man from seeking legal advice, in fact, poses no harm to justice. Bentham seems to define justice as convicting the guilty. This definition focuses on outcomes but ignores fair process—or rather, it assumes that fair procedures are whatever result in correct outcomes. Do you agree? Quite apart from due <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page273" class="pagebreak" title="273">273</span>process concerns, are there moral objections to convicting the guilty by deterring them from candid legal consultations?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Moreover, is it always true that “the innocent man has nothing to fear and therefore will not be deterred” from speaking openly to his attorney? What about cases in which individuals falsely believe that they are guilty, perhaps because they are unaware of available legal defenses (duress, necessity, self-defense, diminished capacity)? What about civil cases where an available defense (such as contributory negligence) is contingent on initially admitting fault, which defendants may be unwilling to do because they do not understand the defense?</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.638" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.638" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Bentham might respond that such cases are infrequent, so that the gains to law enforcement of abolishing the attorney-client privilege outweigh the wrongful convictions. What is your view?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Bentham’s argument chiefly concerns criminal matters, in which a defendant will be found either guilty or not. But in civil disputes, as Wigmore notes, both sides may have bad facts they wish to keep secret.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.639" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.639" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> However, Bentham was convinced that his argument was even stronger in civil lawsuits than in criminal cases, for in the civil case, the effect of abolishing the privilege is less harsh than in criminal cases: The penalty for losing does not include punishment. Is this persuasive?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Wigmore also suggests that Bentham’s proposal would have an adverse effect on the legal profession.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="color: #000000;">The consideration of “treachery,” so inviting an argument for Bentham’s sarcasms, is after all not to be dismissed with a sneer</span>. . . .<span style="color: #000000;"> Certainly the position of the legal adviser would be a difficult and disagreeable one, for it must be repugnant to any honorable man to feel that the confidences which his relation naturally invites are liable at the opponent’s behest to be laid open through his own testimony. He cannot but feel the disagreeable inconsistency of being at the same time the solicitor and the revealer of the secrets of the cause. This double-minded attitude would create an unhealthy moral state in the practitioner.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.640" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.640" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What is Wigmore’s basis for suggesting that abolishing the privilege would induce a more “unhealthy moral state” in practitioners than does obligating them to stay silent, perhaps against their will?</span>

When the lawyers later attempted to testify about this confession on Macumber’s behalf, the prosecutor invoked the attorney-client privilege on behalf of the deceased client, contending that the attorney-client privilege remains intact after the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page274" class="pagebreak" title="274">274</span>client’s death. The trial judge agreed and rejected the lawyers’ proposed testimony. Macumber was convicted, and on appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld the privilege’s invocation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.642" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.642" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Macumber</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> reemerged dramatically during the 1994 Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. (Whitewater was a dubious Arkansas real estate venture in which the Clintons had invested years earlier.) During that investigation, the Independent Counsel attempted to compel testimony from a law firm that had represented Vincent Foster. Foster, a White House aide, had committed suicide, and the special prosecutor wished to learn what Foster had told attorneys that may have been relevant to Whitewater inquiries. The D.C. Circuit held that the importance of the ongoing federal criminal investigation outweighed the importance of maintaining the attorney-client privilege after the client’s death. </span>

The Court reaffirmed the traditional contours of the common-law attorney-client privilege, and rejected attempts to limit the privilege by balancing it against other concerns. Justice O’Connor’s dissenting opinion argued that the privilege should yield in the face of compelling law enforcement needs, such as when information may be necessary to exonerate an innocent defendant.</span>

The client told them that he committed the offense, and appeared gleeful that someone else was convicted for it. After their client died, the attorneys came forward. They acknowledged that they would have disclosed the information earlier if Logan had been sentenced to death. Logan stated in the televised interview that a sentence to life in prison is a kind of living death.</span>

The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page275" class="pagebreak" title="275">275</span>only well-established line of cases that permits such balancing involves the so-called “corporate fiduciary exception” to the privilege in stockholder derivative suits.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.645" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink"> The leading case is </span><a id="dabmci_2dcf8d48d5e94980a4beec2d993aee6b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">Garner v.

Rather than declaring the privilege absolute, <span style="font-style: italic;">Garner</span> held that courts must balance the benefits of disclosure against the costs. Courts that follow <span style="font-style: italic;">Garner</span> generally note that the parties seeking privileged information are stockholders of the corporation, who thus have some claim to being the corporate attorneys’ “real” clients. Since management-defendants owe fiduciary obligations to these shareholders, the latter have a specially protected interest in obtaining sufficient information to ensure that such obligations are met. Thus, these cases do not represent genuine exceptions to <span style="font-style: italic;">Swidler &amp; Berlin</span>’s no-balancing approach.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The issue of whether the privilege should be balanced against other societal concerns is fundamental to its justification. If the justification of the privilege is basically utilitarian, it seems appropriate to weigh its objectives against other utilitarian ends. If, on the other hand, the justification rests on non-utilitarian values, such as respecting the rights and dignity of the client, the Supreme Court’s no-balancing framework of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Swidler &amp; Berlin</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> seems appropriate. Which approach makes the most sense to you? Where should the rights and dignity of non-clients figure in this analysis? Does the Court’s ruling in </span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ultimately, Bentham’s argument against the attorney-client privilege is that it defeats justice by allowing wrongdoers to hide guilty facts with the assistance of a lawyer. When all else is said, how strong is Bentham’s point?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The most significant exception to the attorney-client privilege arises when a client attempts to use an attorney’s services to further a crime or fraud. Why the crime-fraud exception? Historically, many courts explained that when clients have misconduct in mind, they are not consulting attorneys in their professional capacity—as officers of the court—and thus no attorney-client relationship has formed.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.646" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.646" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Yet this argument seems artificial: It implies that the attorney-client relationship switches on and off as the conversation shifts from honest to dishonest topics. There are other, more straightforward, rationales for the crime-fraud exception. The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page276" class="pagebreak" title="276">276</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">encourage clients to obtain legal advice that will facilitate their compliance with legal obligations or their vindication of legal rights. Such objectives do not encompass client efforts to violate the law. In Justice Cardozo’s words, “the privilege takes flight if the relation is abused. A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.” </span>
        <a id="dabmci_23fda168af754dc18c8afd8b27385b41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Clark v. United States</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, 289 U.S. 1, 15 (1933)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The crime-fraud exception has three primary conditions. First, a client’s </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">intent</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> to commit a crime or fraud is enough to create the exception, regardless of whether the client believes the act to be a crime or fraud, even if the client forms the wrongful intent </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">after</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the lawyer-client conversation, and even if the client does not actually succeed in accomplishing the wrongful purpose.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.647" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.647" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Paul Rice, the author of a treatise on the attorney-client privilege, justifies the position as follows:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The client’s communications should not retroactively be afforded the protection of the privilege simply because . . . , as a result of some fortuity, [he] did not have an opportunity or was unable to accomplish his illegal end. The wrong is the seeking of legal advice with the improper motive. If that is established, the client is not innocent.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.648" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.648" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Second, it is the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">client’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> intent to commit crime or fraud that is relevant, not the lawyer’s. The crime-fraud exception applies even if the lawyer has no knowledge of the client’s illicit motive. Conversely, if the client has no criminal or fraudulent intent, the attorney-client privilege remains applicable even if the attorney’s intentions are wrongful.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Consider, for example, the following scenario: A client tells his counsel something false, and the counsel, believing it to be true, repeats it to a federal official. Making false statements to the federal government is a felony (under </span>
        <a id="dabmci_3d64717a3ba743dda15e4c8dc1c55266" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">18 U.S.C. § 1001</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">), and the client intended to deceive even though the lawyer did not. Although this scenario is probably something that every white-collar defense lawyer has experienced more than once, it is an open-and-shut case where the crime-fraud exception applies. One high-profile example of this pitfall arose during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged connections between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. The (unnamed) targets in this particular case were campaign aides Rick Gates and Paul Manafort.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.649" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.649" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The court, finding that the attorney had passed along false information from them to the government, found that </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page277" class="pagebreak" title="277">277</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">the case triggered the crime-fraud exception. The court compelled the attorney to answer several factual questions regarding communications with the clients. Gates was convicted of false statements, while Manafort pled guilty to other crimes.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Third, the exception applies only to conversations that are in furtherance of the crime or fraud. Thus, discussion of ongoing or future crimes and frauds are usually subject to the crime-fraud exception, but professional conversations about a client’s </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">past</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> misconduct usually remain protected. Usually, but not always: A conversation about how to cover up a past crime or fraud may be in furtherance of it, while a conversation in which the lawyer successfully dissuades the client from an intended crime or fraud is clearly not in furtherance of it.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;">The crime-fraud exception was crucial in the massive tobacco litigation of the 1990s, which eventually resulted in a multi-billion dollar settlement between tobacco companies and state governments, which sued to collect the healthcare costs for smoking-related illnesses that states had borne for decades. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">From the 1950s to the 1990s, tobacco companies were frequently sued by individuals over smoking-related illnesses, but the companies never lost a case. In part, this was because juries regularly regarded smoking as chosen, voluntary behavior, but it was also because for much of this period the industry succeeded in casting doubt on the causal connection between smoking and illnesses. One industry tactic involved creating a research institute that funded studies of the health effects of smoking. In reality, the institute made public only those studies that supported the industry’s claim of no causal connection between smoking and illness; studies showing the opposite were suppressed. To help protect the secrecy of its studies, scientists submitted the studies to tobacco industry lawyers, who asserted attorney-client privilege to resist disclosing them. In one case, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin reviewed documents <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span>, and concluded as follows:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page279" class="pagebreak" title="279">279</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Despite the industry’s promise to engage independent researchers to explore the dangers of cigarette smoking and to publicize their findings, the evidence clearly suggests that the research was not independent; that potentially adverse results were shielded under the caption of “special projects;” that the attorney-client privilege was intentionally employed to guard against such unwanted disclosure; and that the promise of full disclosure was never meant to be honored and never was.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.656" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.656" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The full disclosure of these documents finally came a few years later, in the tobacco litigation of the 1990s. Unlike the personal injury cases, here the plaintiffs were states suing tobacco companies for healthcare costs. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The case that finally pierced the attorney-client privilege on industry documents was the State of Minnesota’s suit against seven tobacco companies. The state argued that certain categories of documents were not privileged in the first instance, and that others fell under the crime-fraud exception. One important precedent was the prior application of the crime-fraud exception in products liability litigation about the Dalkon Shield IUD. As noted in Problem 3 in Chapter IV, the Shield caused thousands of injuries. When reports of medical problems began to emerge, manufacturer A. H. Robins Corporation directed its research scientists to report their findings on safety to the company’s lawyers, rather than executives or doctors, in order to shield them behind the attorney-client privilege. During subsequent litigation, the court found a prima facie case of the crime-fraud exception.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.657" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.657" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Minnesota’s strategy in the tobacco litigation succeeded brilliantly. In total, Minnesota would eventually compel the production of millions of pages of documents from all defendants. The break in the case came when one defendant decided to settle separately with the state. It agreed to waive privilege on crucial documents. The state leveraged these to establish a prima facie case of crime-fraud that defeated the privilege asserted by the other defendants.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The trial court agreed that there was a prima facie case of fraud.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.658" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.658" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> It cited to extensive documentary evidence, including:</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One controversial issue concerning these disclosures arose because the sheer number of documents (about 35 million) was so enormous that the special master could not possibly examine them all </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">in camera</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> to determine whether they were privileged—the judge calculated that doing so would take the special master more than six years, doing nothing but reading documents 2000 hours per year. Instead, the court approved a technique of “sampling” documents from different categories and then making a privilege determination for all documents in the category.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.660" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.660" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Inevitably, some privileged documents were revealed. The sampling procedure was intensely controversial. “This is completely and utterly without precedent,” claimed counsel to Brown &amp; Williamson. “You can’t even find sweepings in the corners of law libraries to suggest that this is appropriate.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.661" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.661" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Jones Day litigation chairman John Strauch agreed: “I can’t think of a worse system for something as important as attorney-client privilege.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.662" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.662" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Given the practicalities, was there any feasible alternative to the sampling technique?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The tactic of channeling sensitive information through lawyers to protect it from discovery is sometimes nicknamed “information laundering.” If a scientist—or, more generally, any corporate employee—reports information directly to management, their communications are not privileged. But if the employee reports the same information to counsel, that conversation is arguably privileged; so is the conversation when counsel passes along the information to management. Inserting counsel between the parties “launders” the information, turning discoverable information into privileged information. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One upshot of the Dalkon Shield and Minnesota tobacco cases is that, under some circumstances, information laundering signifies fraudulent intent, in which case the crime-fraud exception pierces the privilege and defeats concealment. What are those circumstances? In both examples, the alleged fraud consisted of the tobacco industry reassuring the public that it was studying the health issues in good faith, when in fact it was burying the truth. What if the companies hadn’t lied to the public? Might it be argued <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page281" class="pagebreak" title="281">281</span>that setting up an information laundering system is itself sufficient to trigger the crime-fraud exception? Alternatively, might it be argued that laundering information through counsel does not create an attorney-client privilege in the first place, if the purpose is to conceal information rather than to obtain legal advice?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Channeling information through counsel in order to protect it remains a common practice; the general counsel of a major food corporation reports that the decision whether to do so is one that in-house lawyers confront on a regular basis.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.663" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.663" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Conversations in furtherance of a crime or fraud are unprivileged. But what constitutes a fraud? Many frauds are crimes, specified as such by statute. Thus, for example, frauds are defined in ninety-two federal criminal statutes.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.664" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.664" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> But the phrase “crime <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span> fraud” makes it clear that the exception applies to civil conduct as well as criminal conduct, and the boundaries of civil fraud are murkier.</p>

The facts reveal: (1) that the plaintiff has left the country with the children in direct violation of a court order; (2) that the plaintiff’s attorney knows the precise whereabouts of her client and declines to disclose that information; (3) that the failure to disclose that information assists the plaintiff in her ongoing contempt of the court’s order; and (4) that the court’s ability to effectuate subsequent orders issued in the best interests of the children has been thwarted.</span>

Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to compel counsel to reveal the whereabouts of the plaintiff and the children is granted.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is the court’s rationale for denying the plaintiff’s claim of privilege? Is it that the “privilege must yield . . . to the best interests of the children,” or that “the plaintiff’s willful contempt in leaving the country in violation of the court’s order constitutes a fraud on the court” and thus creates the crime-fraud exception? The first theory seems too broad: It virtually eliminates the attorney-client privilege in cases involving the wellbeing of minor children. The second theory is also very broad: It seems to imply that any violation of a court order constitutes a fraud on the court. A third possibility is that violating a court order contrary to the best interests of minor children constitutes a fraud on the court. What might be the rationale for this more limited theory? Is it relevant that a Department of Justice (DOJ) report estimated that about 204,000 children are abducted annually by family members?<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.665" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.665" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span></p>

On April 10, your client asks you whether, if he lists last year’s profits from his computer activities on his current federal income tax return, the information might be used as evidence against him in the anti-spamming case. You answer that it might indeed, although you are certainly not recommending that he fail to report income. He changes the subject and does not mention his taxes again.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A few months after the April 15th income tax filing date, the government convenes a grand jury to investigate possible income tax evasion by your client, based on the fact that his federal tax return lists no income from his computer activities. The federal prosecutor subpoenas you to testify about any conversations you had with your client about his federal income tax prior to April 15th. You assert the attorney-client privilege, based on the fact that your conversations with your client concerned his defense against the anti-spamming charges. In response, the prosecutor argues that the crime-fraud exception applies.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">An ABA task force strongly opposed these regulations. The task force insisted that monitoring would unduly chill essential conversations between attorneys and their clients. The task force also argued that the regulations violate a federal statute requiring that federal detainees “be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> In addition, in the task force’s view, the privilege team (which it refers to as the “taint team”) would, in reality, provide no protection of privileged conversations:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="color: #000000;">Existing case law . . . clearly establishes that when an inmate makes telephone calls over a telephone line that he or she knows is monitored, the necessary expectation of confidentiality is lacking and the calls therefore do not qualify as privileged </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">ab initio</span>. . . .<span style="color: #000000;"> Thus, under established case law, the taint team would have legal support for finding that </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">none</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of the recorded attorney-client consultations they are called upon to review fall within the scope of the privilege, because the requisite expectation of confidentiality is lacking. And even if the government is willing to foreswear taking such an approach, there is nothing to prevent co-defendants, defendants in related cases, or private plaintiffs, for example from maintaining that these conversations were unprivileged and should be discoverable, either by subpoenaing the tapes or by subpoenaing the attorney involved. Indeed, where a taint team learns information in the course of monitoring an interview that may exculpate another individual, the government will be required—under </span><a id="dabmci_d37576025fe64bd1987fda9f4c097795" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Brady v.

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How useful is the regulation likely to be in deterring terrorists? How much is it likely to interfere with candid attorney-client conversations?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The regulation states: “[C]ommunications between the inmate and attorneys or their agents are not protected by the attorney-client privilege if they would facilitate criminal acts or a conspiracy to commit criminal acts.” Is this a correct statement of the crime-fraud exception? Can a communication facilitate criminal acts without the client intending the conversation to further those acts? Suppose the conversation is about taking the Fifth Amendment when the client is asked to name names of individuals who may be conspiring to commit criminal acts.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The regulation permits secret taping of attorney-client conversations in prison, without notification, if a federal judge approves it. Such secret taping occurred in Lynne Stewart’s conversations with Sheik Abdel Rahman (see Chapter 4). The regulation also permits the privilege team to reveal privileged information if a judge so orders. Are these provisions justified?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The ABA fears that review of tapes by a privilege team will not protect any attorney-client conversations because no conversations that occur while the parties know they are being taped will be protected in the first place. Is this realistic?

        <span style="color: #000000;">2013, a Staff Judge Advocate confirmed allegations by </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Guantánamo defense counsel that privileged and confidential attorney-client conversations had regularly been monitored through secret microphones disguised as smoke detectors in interview rooms.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Previously, defense counsel had been assured that no such monitoring was taking place. The problem recurred in 2017, leading to a dramatic legal ethics confrontation when capital defense counsel withdrew from their case on the ground that they could not count on a secure space to speak with their client. The government responded that a microphone defense counsel had discovered in a client interview room was merely a “legacy microphone” no longer in use—</span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page288" class="pagebreak" title="288">288</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The military judge sided with the government and ordered defense counsel back to work. But then information emerged that the judge had been secretly negotiating with the Justice Department for a post-retirement job. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated all his rulings dating back to November 2015, when his job negotiations began.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Obviously, the organization speaks through management, but no member of management is “the client” of the organization’s lawyer. This raises questions about which communications between a lawyer and the organization’s officers and employees lie within the attorney-client privilege. Whose confidences must be kept? And from whom?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">If, for example, a corporation’s CEO tells the lawyer in confidence that he has committed acts constituting embezzlement, the lawyer’s fiduciary duties clearly run to the corporation, not the CEO. Counsel must therefore inform the board of directors of the embezzlement. Yet the situation remains one of some delicacy, because the CEO may have been relying on the lawyer’s duty of confidentiality. For this reason, Rule 1.13(f) states:</span>

      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In effect, the lawyer must issue warnings to corporate officers and employees if it is clear that they are communicating information that cannot be held in confidence. As illustrated in the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> employees and agents of the organization personify the client for purposes of the privilege. For many years, courts employed two different approaches in identifying the client for purposes of the attorney-client privilege. One approach restricted the privilege to conversations between the corporation’s lawyer and members of its “control group,” that is, senior management.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">In the following decision, the Supreme Court addressed the question of which employees’ conversations with lawyers are covered by the organizational privilege and rejected both the previous tests. In the case, auditors working for Upjohn, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, discovered that one of the company’s subsidiaries had made illegal payments to foreign officials in return for government business. Gerard Thomas, Upjohn’s general counsel, began an internal investigation that included employee interviews and questionnaires. In 1976, Upjohn voluntarily reported on the illegal payments to the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS began its own investigation, and demanded that Upjohn produce the questionnaires and Thomas’s interview notes. Upjohn refused the discovery request on the grounds of attorney-client privilege. Relying on the “control group” test, the District Court rejected the claim of privilege. The Sixth Circuit supported the District Court and </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">We granted certiorari in this case to address important questions concerning the scope of the attorney-client privilege in the corporate context</span>. . . .<span style="color: #000000;"> With respect to the privilege question the parties and various </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">amici</span><span style="color: #000000;"> have described our task as one of choosing between two “tests” which have gained adherents in the courts of appeals. We are acutely aware, however, that we sit to decide concrete cases and not abstract propositions of law. We decline to lay down a broad rule or series of rules to govern all conceivable future questions in this area, even were we able to do so. We can and do, however, conclude that the attorney-client privilege protects the communications involved in this case from compelled disclosure. . . .</span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">Federal Rule of Evidence 501</span><span style="color: #000000;"> provides that “the privilege of a witness . . . shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in light of reason and experience.” The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law. Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer’s being fully informed by the client</span>. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The Court of Appeals, however, considered the application of the privilege in the corporate context to present a “different problem,” since the client was an inanimate entity and “only the senior management, guiding and integrating the several operations, . . . can be said to possess an identity analogous to the corporation as a whole.” . . . Such a view, we think, overlooks the fact that the privilege exists to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice</span>. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">In the case of the individual client the provider of information and the person who acts on the lawyer’s advice are one and the same. In the corporate context, however, it will frequently be employees beyond the control group as defined by the court below—“officers and agents . . . responsible for directing [the company’s] actions in response to legal advice”—who will possess the information needed by the corporation’s </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page291" class="pagebreak" title="291">291</span><span style="color: #000000;">lawyers. Middle-level—and indeed lower-level—employees can, by actions within the scope of their employment, embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties, and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties. This fact was noted in </span><a id="dabmci_9a748a4935244be19f359414c44ceeb8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Diversified Industries, Inc. v. Meredith</span>, 572 F.2d 596 (C.A.8 1978) (en banc)<span style="color: #000000;">:</span></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In a corporation, it may be necessary to glean information relevant to a legal problem from middle management or non-management personnel as well as from top executives. The attorney dealing with a complex legal problem is thus faced with a “Hobson’s choice.” If he interviews employees not having “the very highest authority,” their communications to him will not be privileged. If, on the other hand, he interviews </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">only</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> those employees with “the very highest authority,” he may find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine what happened.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The control group test adopted by the court below thus frustrates the very purpose of the privilege by discouraging the communication of relevant information by employees of the client to attorneys seeking to render legal advice to the client corporation. The attorney’s advice will also frequently be more significant to noncontrol group members than to those who officially sanction the advice, and the control group test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to the employees who will put into effect the client corporation’s policy</span>. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The narrow scope given the attorney-client privilege by the court below not only makes it difficult for corporate attorneys to formulate sound advice when their client is faced with a specific legal problem but also threatens to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their client’s compliance with the law. In light of the vast and complicated array of regulatory legislation confronting the modern corporation, corporations, unlike most individuals, “constantly go to lawyers to find out how to obey the law,” particularly since compliance with the law in this area is hardly an instinctive matter</span>. . . .<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.681" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.681" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The communications at issue were made by Upjohn employees to counsel for Upjohn acting as such, at the direction of corporate superiors in order to secure legal advice from counsel. . . . The communications concerned matters within the scope of the employees’ corporate duties, and the employees themselves were sufficiently aware that they were </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page292" class="pagebreak" title="292">292</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal advice. . . . Consistent with the underlying purposes of the attorney-client privilege, these communications must be protected against compelled disclosure.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Court of Appeals declined to extend the attorney-client privilege beyond the limits of the control group test for fear that doing so would entail severe burdens on discovery and create a broad “zone of silence” over corporate affairs. Application of the attorney-client privilege to communications such as those involved here, however, puts the adversary in no worse position than if the communications had never taken place. The privilege only protects disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">Here the Government was free to question the employees who communicated with Thomas and outside counsel. Upjohn has provided the IRS with a list of such employees, and the IRS has already interviewed some 25 of them. While it would probably be more convenient for the Government to secure the results of petitioner’s internal investigation by simply subpoenaing the questionnaires and notes taken by petitioner’s attorneys, such considerations of convenience do not overcome the policies served by the attorney-client privilege. As Justice Jackson noted in his concurring opinion in </span><a id="dabmci_8c8c12ca6d1e47729409e5a3fc73d0d0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Hickman v.

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Though the Court repudiates the control group test, it “decline[s] to lay down a broad rule” and proposes a case-by-case determination of the scope of the privilege. Does the decision offer sufficiently concrete guidance to corporate attorneys or employees as to whether their conversations are protected?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Upjohn</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> majority stresses that the disclosures at issue came from employees who were acting like clients in a crucial respect: informing attorneys about the case. The Court concludes that the attorney-client privilege must therefore protect communications with any corporate employees from whom the attorney must obtain information for purposes of the representation. How, if at all, does this differ from the subject matter test? </span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> § 79</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, which protects communications between any agent of the organization and the organization’s lawyer “concern[ing] a legal matter of interest to the organization” if “disclosed only to: (a) privileged persons . . . ; and (b) other agents of the organization who reasonably need to know of the communication in order to act for the organization”?</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page293" class="pagebreak" title="293">293</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Why do organizations get the benefit of the attorney-client privilege at all? As Section B suggests, the most common argument for the attorney-client privilege is that it encourages frank disclosures. The assumption is that, with the privilege in place, the client has little to fear in disclosing sensitive information; without the privilege, on the other hand, </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">lawyer-client communication would be chilled and circumscribed.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">But how realistic are those assumptions when the attorney is investigating possible wrongdoing by a corporate employee? Management, after all, is very likely to sanction, fire, or sue an employee who has landed the company in legal difficulties. And if the lawyer interviewing an employee warns that the corporation has sole discretion to waive or assert the privilege, how comfortable will employees feel in discussing possible misconduct? At the same time, in at least some cases, employees or officers will <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> to consult with counsel irrespective of the privilege because their jobs depend on it or because such consultation can later shield them from liability through the “advice of counsel” defense.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.682" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.682" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Then, while the utilitarian justification for the attorney-client privilege is arguably weaker when the client is an entity, rather than an individual, the social costs of extending the privilege are arguably greater. As one of the earliest commentators on the corporate attorney-client privilege explained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[W]here corporations are involved, with their large number of agents, masses of documents and frequent dealings with lawyers, the zone of silence grows large. Few judges—or legislators either, for that matter—would long tolerate any common law privilege that allowed corporations to insulate all their activities by discussing them with legal advisors.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.683" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.683" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Meanwhile, in addition to the above utilitarian justification, the attorney-client privilege is often, generally, justified based on the need to protect individual rights such as privacy and freedom from self-incrimination. But like the utilitarian rationale, non-utilitarian arguments for the attorney-client privilege carry considerably less weight when the client is an organization instead of an individual. As Charles Wolfram writes, “arguments [for the corporate privilege] based on human dignity are irrelevant. The corporation as an entity has no legal or moral claims to dignity. The humans who act as the agents of the corporation are entitled to such dignity, but individually they are not the client.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.684" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.684" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">If the typical justifications are doubtful, how else might the corporate attorney-client privilege be justified?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">One possible justification, somewhat different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span>’s, proceeds in four steps: (1) Without extensive protection for lawyer-client communication, corporate counsel will be cut “out of the loop”—employees and management will withhold sensitive information from legal advisers. (2) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page294" class="pagebreak" title="294">294</span>In that case, attorneys will be unable to counsel their clients in order to prevent illegal behavior. (3) A significant part of a corporate attorney’s role includes attempting to prevent misconduct. (4) Clients are often willing to be dissuaded from improper activities by their attorneys, for if they were not, they would not seek costly legal advice in the first place.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.685" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.685" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> The conclusion is that a broad attorney-client privilege enhances corporate compliance with legal standards.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you find this argument persuasive? Are any steps of the syllogism questionable?<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.686" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.686" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span> Do you believe that the attorney-client privilege is justified, when applied to organizations rather than individuals?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Critics of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Upjohn</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> have claimed that giving a broad scope to the corporate attorney-client privilege will turn corporate attorneys into “black holes” of information. Attorneys investigating corporate internal affairs on behalf of management may well be the only corporate officers with a full and clear picture of the matter being investigated. All the attorneys’ conversations on the subject are privileged, including conversations in which they report to management the findings of their internal investigation, and thus the total picture drops into a black hole. Information goes in, but it never comes out.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Consider the Dalkon Shield and tobacco cases, discussed in Part C, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>. Recall that research scientists working for the Dalkon Shield’s manufacturer were directed to report their findings on safety to the company’s lawyers, rather than executives or doctors, in order to shield those findings behind the attorney-client privilege. Tobacco research was similarly channeled through industry lawyers, who then claimed that it was protected by the privilege—a black hole that lasted for decades. To critics, <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span>’s broad protection for corporate communications assists such “information laundering” cover-ups of corporate wrongdoing and impedes regulatory oversight.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Graham B. Spanier appeals from the order denying his pre-trial motions to preclude the introduction of testimony of Cynthia Baldwin and quash certain criminal charges against him based on violations of the attorney-client privilege.<a id="co_fnRef_B00322038152297_ID0EHOAC_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> We find that Ms. Baldwin breached the attorney-client privilege and was incompetent to testify as to confidential communications between her and Spanier during her grand jury testimony. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court’s determination <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page295" class="pagebreak" title="295">295</span>otherwise, and quash the charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy related to those counts.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Commonwealth has charged Spanier with perjury, failure to report suspected child abuse, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to commit perjury, conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, conspiracy to commit endangering the welfare of a child (“EWOC”), and two counts of EWOC.<a id="co_fnRef_B00432038152297_ID0EIBAE_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> The charges stem from: 1) his treatment of allegations of sexual misconduct against Gerald “Jerry” A. Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the Penn State football team and founder of a non-profit charity serving underprivileged youth, the Second Mile; 2) his testimony pertaining to his handling of those matters before an investigating grand jury, and 3) the testimony of Cynthia Baldwin.<a id="co_fnRef_B00542038152297_ID0EACAE_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Spanier is the former President of the Pennsylvania State University (“Penn State” or “University”). In 2009, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General (“OAG”) began investigating allegations that Sandusky sexually abused children over an extended period. As part of the investigation, the OAG convened a statewide investigating Grand Jury. During the course of the investigation, the OAG learned of sexual misconduct by Sandusky that occurred while he was on the campus of Penn State in 2001, as well as an incident involving inappropriate behavior with a minor in 1998. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As part of the criminal investigation into Sandusky, . . . Ms. Baldwin was served with a subpoena <span style="font-style: italic;">duces tecum</span>, Grand Jury Subpoena 1179, for University documents referencing or related to Jerry Sandusky after 1997. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Spanier was summoned to testify before the grand jury on April 13, 2011. . . . Prior to Spanier’s April testimony, but on the same day of that testimony, Ms. Baldwin objected to the scope of Subpoena 1179 before Judge Barry Feudale, the grand jury supervising judge. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After she left the room, and outside of Spanier’s presence, the OAG represented to Judge Feudale that [there were inconsistencies between statements by various Penn State officials including Spanier]. Hence, it was clear at that point to both Judge Feudale and the OAG that the grand jury was investigating the actions of high-ranking Penn State officials, including . . . Spanier. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During this exchange, Judge Feudale referred to Ms. Baldwin as counsel for Spanier . . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Subsequently, after discussions regarding compliance with the Subpoena 1179 were coming to a close, Judge Feudale inquired, “Cindy [Baldwin], just for the record, who do you represent?” Outside the presence of Spanier, and for the first time on the record, Ms. Baldwin responded, “The university.” Judge Feudale followed up, “The university solely?” Ms. Baldwin answered, “Yes, I represent the university solely.” . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page296" class="pagebreak" title="296">296</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite Ms. Baldwin’s earlier averment that she solely represented the University, Judge Feudale did not colloquy Spanier regarding the scope or type of representation he was being afforded by Ms. Baldwin.<a id="co_fnRef_B00872038152297_ID0EP4AE_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> Additionally, the OAG did not express concern over Ms. Baldwin being present for Spanier’s testimony. Upon entering the grand jury room, the OAG queried, “Sir, you’re represented by counsel today?” Spanier responded, “Yes.” The OAG then asked, “Could you just identify counsel?” Spanier answered, “Cynthia Baldwin sitting behind me.”<a id="co_fnRef_B00982038152297_ID0ER6AE_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Subsequently, Baldwin herself was called to testify before the grand jury.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In preparation for Ms. Baldwin’s grand jury appearance, Judge Feudale conducted a conference with Mr. Mustokoff, the OAG, and Ms. Baldwin’s attorney on October 22, 2012. Due to the secrecy attendant to <a id="co_pp_sp_7691_487_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />grand jury proceedings, Spanier was not aware that Ms. Baldwin was going to testify and could not lodge any objection. New counsel for [University officials] Curley and Schultz already had provided letters to the OAG, Judge Feudale, and counsel for Ms. Baldwin, invoking the attorney-client privilege. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Counsel for Penn State astutely noted that it could not waive any privilege that Curley and Schultz might have and again declined to waive its privilege as to communications between Ms. Baldwin and Curley and Schultz. The OAG, via Attorney Frank Fina, submitted at that time that it would not question Ms. Baldwin about matters that could involve potential confidential communications between Curley, Schultz, Spanier and Ms. Baldwin. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[However, Attorney Fina did in fact question Baldwin about conversations with Spanier, which she answered fully. Her answers contradicted Spanier’s prior grand jury testimony. At one point in the questioning, she testified that public statements by Spanier about the sex abuse scandal were false, and added that “he is not a person of integrity. He lied to me.” She then repeated, “I can’t get inside his mind, but the fact is that there is no doubt that he lied to me. I can’t think of any reason, other reason for lying than trying to hide it from me.”] </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Following Ms. Baldwin’s testimony, that same day, the grand jury recommended charges against Spanier for failure to report suspected child abuse, perjury, obstruction of justice, EWOC, conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, conspiracy to commit perjury, and conspiracy to commit EWOC. The Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint containing those charges on November 1, 2012, and the grand jury presentment was attached to the complaint as the basis for the charges. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the companion case of <a id="dabmci_1d756258e50c4348861c02b9b47a163e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Schultz, Commonwealth v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;23;dabmci_1d756258e50c4348861c02b9b47a163e_1;I2bf23717c38c11e590d4edf60ce7d742;;0;S;Commonwealth v.

Super. 2016), . . . we . . . set forth the general principles of law governing the attorney-client privilege as follows. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The attorney-client relationship exists not only in one-on-one situations between an individual and an attorney, but it can also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page297" class="pagebreak" title="297">297</span>exist in a corporate environment in which general counsel or legal staff is present. “When the client is a corporation, the privilege extends to communications between its attorney and agents or employees authorized to act on the corporation’s behalf.” . . . In <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span>, the United States Supreme Court analyzed the scope of the attorney-client privilege when the client is a corporation. Although <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span> itself did not involve warnings or a discussion of a lawyer’s explanation regarding the scope of his representation, the Supreme Court observed that, under certain situations, information about the extent of the attorney-client relationship between a corporate counsel and an employee might be necessary. As a result of that case, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span> warnings” have evolved that specifically inform a corporate employee that corporate counsel represents the corporation and not the individual, and that the corporation possesses the attorney-client privilege. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">In addition to the traditional attorney-client relationship and the corporate environment, the attorney-client privilege also can exist in the context of co-defendants and their attorney or attorneys. When multiple defendants and their counsel engage in a common defense, the privilege is not waived by the sharing of confidential information among the parties for the benefit of the joint defense. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[W]e find that Ms. Baldwin did not adequately explain to Spanier that her representation of him was solely as an agent of Penn State and that she did not represent his individual interests. Although Spanier knew Ms. Baldwin was general counsel for Penn State, this knowledge does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> result in Spanier understanding that she represented him solely in an agency capacity before the grand jury. Spanier was not aware that Ms. Baldwin was not appearing with him in order to protect his interests and therefore unable to provide advice concerning whether he should answer potentially incriminating questions or invoke his right against self-incrimination. In line with our holdings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Schultz</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Curley</span>, we conclude that Ms. Baldwin was incompetent to testify at the grand jury hearing as to communications between her and Spanier. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">In <span style="font-style: italic;">Schultz</span>, . . . we asserted,</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">As our Rules of Professional Conduct illustrate, communications between a putative client and corporate counsel are generally privileged prior to counsel informing the individual of the distinction between representing the individual as an agent of the corporation and representing the person in his or her personal capacity. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(c) (lawyer may limit scope of representation provided the client gives informed consent); Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.0(e) (defining <a id="co_pp_sp_7691_497_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />“informed consent”); <span style="font-style: italic;">see also</span> Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.6(a) (“A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page298" class="pagebreak" title="298">298</span>unless the client gives informed consent, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out representation and except as stated in paragraphs (b) and (c).”); <span style="font-style: italic;">see also</span> Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.18(b) (“Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal information which may be significantly harmful to that person”).</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">When corporate counsel clarifies the potential inherent conflict of interest in representing the corporation and an individual and explains that the attorney may divulge the communications between that person and the attorney because they do not represent the individual, the individual may then make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decision whether to continue communicating with corporate counsel. This is all the more essential where the purpose of the individual seeking advice relates to an appearance and testimony before a criminal investigating grand jury.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Absent a privilege existing for preliminary communications, the putative client cannot have full and frank discussions with the attorney in order to determine whether it would be appropriate for that lawyer to represent him or her in an individual capacity. <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span> (“Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients.”).</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Furthermore, the attorney might be unable to make a determination as to whether he or she could represent that individual personally if the putative client believes full disclosure will not be kept confidential. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As we discussed in both <span style="font-style: italic;">Schultz</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Curley</span>, communications between a corporate attorney and an employee of a corporation may be personally privileged. It simply does not follow that, if Ms. Baldwin represented Spanier as an agent of Penn State, none of his communications with her were privileged. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For reasons outlined, we agree that an attorney-client relationship existed between Spanier and Ms. Baldwin before and during his grand jury testimony, thereby giving rise to an attorney-client privilege. Ms. Baldwin’s grand jury testimony regarding communications with Spanier constituted a violation of the attorney-client privilege, rendering her incompetent to testify. Accordingly, and in light of our holdings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Schultz</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Curley</span>, we quash the challenged charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to commit those crimes.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As a result of this case, Pennsylvania’s Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed charges against Cynthia Baldwin for violating Pennsylvania Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.6 (confidentiality), 1.7 (conflict of interest), and 8.4 (violation of Rules of Professional Conduct).<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.687" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.687" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> ODC requested that the state Supreme Court censure her, and, in February 2020, the Supreme Court imposed discipline in the form of a public reprimand. Baldwin is herself a former justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As this case indicates, the potential confusion over who an organization’s counsel represents is a dangerous one. Recall Rule 1.13(a): Counsel represents the organization, not its officers as individuals. In that sense, Baldwin gave the right answer in her sidebar with Judge Feudale. And, as mentioned above, Rule 1.13(f) requires organizational counsel to warn officers, employees, and other constituents that counsel represents the organization, not them, “when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the organization’s interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing.” Such explanations are sometimes metaphorically called “<span style="font-style: italic;">Miranda </span>warnings”; here, the court refers to them more accurately as “<span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span> warnings.” In the absence of such warnings, the problem is that an officer like Spanier can form the reasonable belief of representation, creating an implied lawyer-client relationship, to which all duties attached (as discussed in Chapter 5). Do you agree with the court that such a relationship was established here by Baldwin’s conduct? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the wake of corporate scandals around the turn of the 21st century, federal officials began pressuring organizations under investigation to waive the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine in return for leniency.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In 2001, the SEC developed its own approach for evaluating the waiver of privilege as a factor in making charging decisions. Commonly known as the Seaboard report, the SEC’s policy credits companies that offer “complete cooperation” with the SEC staff. A company that offers such “complete cooperation” may face reduced charges or lighter sanctions—or even escape an enforcement action altogether. To exhibit this cooperation, companies must engage in self-policing, self-reporting, remediation, and cooperation—and, in terms of evaluating whether a company has been fully cooperative, the SEC has stated that it considers, among other things, whether the company has sought to hide behind, or alternatively waived, the attorney-client privilege.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.688" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.688" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a>

      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page300" class="pagebreak" title="300">300</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Following the SEC’s lead, in 2003 the DOJ issued a policy memo identifying factors that federal prosecutors should consider in deciding whether to charge organizations with criminal misconduct. These factors included the organization’s timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing, and its willingness to cooperate in the investigation of its agents, even if that cooperation involved waiver of the attorney-client privilege.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.689" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.689" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span> In the face of a firestorm of criticism, however, the DOJ withdrew the controversial policy—and in 2008, it revised the Justice Manual (formerly called the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual) to <span style="font-style: italic;">prohibit</span> federal prosecutors from penalizing businesses for refusing to waive the attorney-client privilege. The new guidance, now binding on federal prosecutors, states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Eligibility for cooperation credit is not predicated upon the waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product protection. Instead, the sort of cooperation that is most valuable to resolving allegations of misconduct by a corporation and its officers, directors, employees, or agents is disclosure of the relevant </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">facts </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">concerning such misconduct. In this regard, the analysis parallels that for a non-corporate defendant, where cooperation typically requires disclosure of relevant factual knowledge and not of discussions between an individual and his attorneys.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.690" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.690" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Still, some commentators, along with the ABA, have worried that the policy might not be extended to all agencies and that the possibility of informal, non-explicit coercion may remain.</span>
      </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861374" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218939" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756357" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908490" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What might be some problems with the Seaboard report or the DOJ’s 2003 policy memo? In raising objections, some have argued that such policies encourage counsel not to make written notes of their investigations and might also impair corporate counsels’ ability to obtain candid disclosures from the corporation’s employees.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.691" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.691" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> Others, however, dispute that the policies would chill the zeal or quality of internal corporate investigations, because corporations cannot afford <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to know everything that a government investigation might unearth.<a id="_Ref33194424" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.692" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.692" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> Do you find either position persuasive?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page301" class="pagebreak" title="301">301</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some commentators believe that privilege waiver has become a symbolic issue to the bar. Because corporations lack the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, defense counsel regard the attorney-client privilege as their only shield. In the eyes of defense counsel, the government seems to believe “that the proper role of corporations confronted with allegations of wrongdoing is, quite simply, to roll over. Individual defendants can fight like hell, but corporations should self-report, remediate harm, cooperate fully, and take whatever prosecutors and regulators believe they have coming. Zealous defense counsel find this assumption beyond galling.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.693" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.693" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> Do you? What might be the SEC’s or DOJ’s rejoinder to this?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A converse problem arises when an organization’s interest lies in maintaining the privilege, but it is in individual directors’ interest for the corporation to waive the privilege. For example, when directors are sued for corporate misconduct, they may wish to raise the defense that they relied on the advice of counsel. In order for them to establish the defense, disclosure of privileged materials will be necessary. How should this dilemma be resolved?<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.694" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.694" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A prior version of the Comment to Rule 4.2 made clear that the Rule prohibited all contact with employees “whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.” Under the federal rules of evidence and many state rules, any statement by an employee concerning matters within the scope of their employment is admissible. The current version of the Comment omits the prohibition against contacting employees. However, Comment 7 states:</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is the purpose of the no-contact rule in an organizational setting? If it is to protect the organization from ill-advised statements, why should it be limited to those constituents as defined in Comment 7 of Rule 4.2? Isn’t the risk that other employees contacted without counsel present might make statements that will strengthen the opposing party’s case?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If the purpose of the rule is to protect the organization, why is permission for contact needed from counsel for an employee who is separately represented, rather than from counsel for the organization? On the other hand, if the concern is for the employee, will his or her best interests be necessarily served by decisions made by the organization’s counsel? In this regard, note that the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">§ 100 permits contact with an opposing party’s agents or employees even if their statements will be admissible but not with agents or employees who direct counsel, have the power to settle the matter, or whose statements would bind the organization or could be imputed to the organization.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Think back to <span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn</span> and recall that one justification for the Court’s decision was that, since the privilege only applies to privileged communications and not underlying facts, “<span style="color: #000000;">the Government was free to question the employees who communicated with” Upjohn’s counsel. Under Rule 4.2, would the IRS’s lawyer have been able to contact the Upjohn employees directly? Could an IRS agent have done so and reported back to the IRS lawyer? If not, does that affect your assessment of whether </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Upjohn</span><span style="color: #000000;"> was properly decided?</span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="Document0zzSDUNumber1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Similar to the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine protects material prepared by or at the behest of counsel in anticipation of litigation or for trial. Grounded on the notion that the opposing party “shouldn’t be allowed to take a free ride on the other party’s research, or get the inside dope on that party’s strategy,” the work-product doctrine establishes a zone of privacy in which lawyers can analyze and prepare their client’s case free from outside scrutiny.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.695" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.695" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The work-product doctrine has its roots in the Supreme Court’s decision in <a id="dabmci_90d319e2d4c543d8bb58d3d31ee112fc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Hickman v.

Taylor</span>, 329 U.S. 495 (1947). <span style="font-style: italic;">Hickman</span> involved a personal injury accident case where the defense lawyer, Samuel B. Fortenbaugh, Jr., privately interviewed several of the accident’s survivors and witnesses and “took statements from them with an eye toward the anticipated litigation.”<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><a id="dabmci_194b93754e32497e8994527ea89bf920" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;">329 U.S. at 497</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> Sometime later, a representative of a victim who died in the accident sued and filed an interrogatory asking, essentially, whether any of the accident’s survivors were interviewed and, if so, for Fortenbaugh’s interview notes.<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><a id="dabmci_6c7b032e23764b8980ed811a24a2a90b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Id</span><span style="color: #000000;">. at 509</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page303" class="pagebreak" title="303">303</span>Fortenbaugh initially balked, claiming that the notes were governed by the attorney-client privilege. But the district court disagreed, insisting that the notes, containing statements made by third parties, were not so protected—and the court ordered disclosure. Then, when Fortenbaugh still refused to disclose the notes in contravention of the court’s order, the court adjudged Fortenbaugh in contempt and ordered him imprisoned.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The case ultimately made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the district court’s ruling while creating the work-product doctrine of today. In so doing, a unanimous Court reasoned:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Historically, a lawyer is an officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while faithfully protecting the rightful interests of his clients. In performing his various duties, however, it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Proper preparation of a client’s case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference. That is the historical and the necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their clients’ interests. This work is reflected, of course, in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways—aptly though roughly termed . . . the ‘Work product of the lawyer.’ Were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand, much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten. An attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In a now-famous concurrence, Justice Jackson, joined by Justice Frankfurter, agreed, reasoning:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[A] common law trial is and always should be an adversary proceeding. Discovery was hardly intended to enable a learned profession to perform its functions either without wits or on wits borrowed from the adversary. The real purpose and the probable effect of the practice ordered by the district court would be to put trials on a level even lower than a ‘battle of wits.’ I can conceive of no practice more demoralizing to the Bar than to require a lawyer to write out and deliver to his adversary an account of what witnesses have told him.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Unlike the attorney-client privilege, however, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Hickman</span> Court held that work-product protection is not absolute.

      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other hand, while the work-product doctrine is only a qualified privilege (and, as such, can be overcome in ways that the attorney-client privilege cannot be overcome), in other respects it is more robust than the attorney-client privilege. Specifically, while the disclosure of a privileged document to any third party typically waives the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine is not so easily eviscerated. A 2014 court decision explains the basis for this asymmetrical treatment:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">This disparity in treatment flows from the very different goals the privileges are designed to effectuate. The attorney-client privilege promotes the attorney-client relationship, and, indirectly, the functioning of our legal system, by protecting the confidentiality of communications between clients and their attorneys. <a id="dabmci_f018d3e8bf034af285782cad4918d44f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span><span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Upjohn Co. v. United States&quot; \s &quot;Upjohn Co. v. United States&quot; \c 3 " />, 449 U.S. 383 (1981). In contrast, the work-product doctrine promotes the adversary system directly by protecting the confidentiality of papers prepared by or on behalf of attorneys in anticipation of litigation.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Because the work-product doctrine serves to protect an attorney’s work product from falling into the hands of an adversary, a disclosure to a third party does not automatically waive work-product protection. A waiver occurs when the protected communications are disclosed in a manner that substantially increase[s] the opportunity for potential adversaries to obtain the information.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.698" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.698" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />For a time, it was unclear whether a document could be entitled to work-product protection if the document was prepared, not by a lawyer, but by his or her agent. The Supreme Court put the question to rest in 1975, ruling:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[T]he [work-product] doctrine is an intensely practical one, grounded in the realities of litigation in our adversary system. One of those realities is that attorneys often must rely on the assistance of investigators and other agents in the compilation of materials in preparation for trial. It is therefore necessary that the doctrine protects material prepared by agents for the attorney as well as those prepared by the attorney himself.</p>
      <a id="dabmci_4797136e2c8d4484b661abe1576b93e4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
      <p class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Nobles</span>, 422 U.S. 225, 239 (1975).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The work-product doctrine attaches whenever litigation is in progress or whenever the lawyer reasonably anticipated litigation at the time the material was prepared. “Litigation” includes civil and criminal trial proceedings, as well as alternative dispute resolution proceedings such as mediations, arbitrations, or mini-trials.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />There is a crime-fraud exception to the work-product doctrine as well as to the attorney-client privilege; but the elements are slightly different. Recall that for the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, what matters is the client’s criminal or fraudulent intent, regardless of the lawyer’s. In the work-product context, a lawyer’s fraudulence can trigger the crime-fraud exception even if the client is blameless.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.699" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.699" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Stepping back, the work-product doctrine aims to strike a balance between openness on the one hand and secrecy and privacy on the other, cognizant that, whenever documents are shielded from scrutiny, a party’s search for the truth might be impaired, and the costs of litigation may rise. Recognizing the competing interests at play, do you believe the work-product doctrine strikes a proper balance? Or, would you favor stronger protections for attorney work product or, alternatively, more robust discovery?</p>

      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">We now shift gears, to consider confidentiality, as distinct from the attorney-client privilege. Lawyers’ duties of confidentiality are defined by states’ Rules of Professional Conduct. Curiously, however, the view that lawyers have an <span style="font-style: italic;">ethical</span> obligation to keep client confidences is a relative newcomer, especially compared with the attorney-client privilege. The earliest treatments of legal ethics in the United States, David Hoffman’s 1836 “Resolutions” and George Sharswood’s 1854 <span style="font-style: italic;">Essay on Professional Ethics</span>, identify no such obligation. The duty of confidentiality appears to have been the invention of the eminent late-nineteenth-century corporate lawyer David Dudley Field.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.700" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.700" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page306" class="pagebreak" title="306">306</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted earlier, the attorney-client privilege prevents lawyers only from offering evidence in legal proceedings about confidential communications with clients. Bar ethical mandates, by contrast, enjoin lawyers from revealing confidential information received from anyone to anyone, in or out of courtrooms. Indeed, Rule 1.6(a) states simply that “[a] lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client.” Moreover, as previous discussion indicates, while the attorney-client privilege is riddled with exceptions that significantly narrow its scope, bar ethical rules offer broader protections, with fewer exceptions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.9(c)(2) makes explicit that the duty of confidentiality extends to former clients as well as current clients, and Rule 1.18(b) extends it to prospective clients as well. The protection of former and prospective clients goes beyond merely <span style="font-style: italic;">revealing </span>confidential information. It also prohibits <span style="font-style: italic;">using</span> confidential information “to the disadvantage of a former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.701" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.701" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> For example, a lawyer who practices in an industry-specific specialty may have acquired important information about a former client company that could be used to that company’s disadvantage, if in the future the lawyer represents a competitor. The ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility has explained the exception for “generally known” information about the former client thus:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[I]nformation is generally known . . . if (a) it is widely recognized by members of the public in the relevant geographic area; or (b) it is widely recognized in the former client’s industry, profession, or trade. . . . Information may be widely recognized within a former client’s industry, profession, or trade without being widely recognized by the public. For example, if a former client is in the insurance industry, information about the former client that is widely recognized by others in the insurance industry should be considered generally known within the meaning of Model Rule 1.9(c)(1) even if the public at large is unaware of the information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.702" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.702" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Powerful as the confidentiality norm is, Rule 1.6, which governs client confidentiality, contains some important exceptions. Explored in more detail below, nearly all of these exceptions have ignited controversy. In the wake of major corporate scandals which led to enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for example, the ABA’s House of Delegates voted to permit a lawyer to disclose confidential information “to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another and in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page307" class="pagebreak" title="307">307</span>furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyer’s services.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.703" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.703" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span> The vote, however, was very close: 218–201.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">The current version of Rule 1.6 provides as follows:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">

In this instant action, Spaulding now seeks to vacate the settlement. Below, the district court ruled in Spaulding’s favor, and Zimmerman appealed.<span style="color: #000000;">]</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">On appeal defendants contend that the court was without jurisdiction to vacate the settlement solely because . . . their counsel then possessed information, unknown to plaintiff herein, that at the time he was suffering from an aorta aneurysm which may have resulted from the accident, because no duty rested upon them to disclose information to plaintiff which they could assume had been disclosed to him by his own physicians</span>. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">After the accident, David’s injuries were diagnosed by his family physician, Dr. James H. Cain, as a severe crushing injury of the chest with multiple rib fractures; a severe cerebral concussion, probably with petechial hemorrhages of the brain; and bilateral fractures of the clavicles. At Dr. Cain’s suggestion, on January 3, 1957, David was examined by Dr. John F. Pohl, an orthopedic specialist, who made X-ray studies of his chest. Dr. Pohl’s detailed report of this examination included the following:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">“ . . . The lung fields are clear. The heart and aorta are normal.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Nothing in such report indicated the aorta aneurysm with which David was then suffering. On March 1, 1957, at the suggestion of Dr. Pohl, David was examined from a neurological viewpoint by Dr. Paul S. Blake, and in the report of this examination there was no finding of the aorta aneurysm.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the meantime, on February 22, 1957, at defendants’ request, David was examined by Dr. Hewitt Hannah, a neurologist. On February 26, 1957, the latter reported to Messrs. Field, Arveson, &amp; Donoho, attorneys for defendant John Zimmerman, as follows:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The one feature of the case which bothers me more than any other part of the case is the fact that this boy of 20 years of age has an aneurysm, which means a dilatation of the aorta and the arch of the aorta. Whether this came out of this accident I cannot say with any degree of certainty and I have discussed it with the Roentgenologist and a couple of Internists</span>. . . .<span style="color: #000000;"> Of course an aneurysm or dilatation of the aorta in a boy of this age is a serious matter as far as his life. This aneurysm may dilate further and it might rupture with further dilatation and this would cause his death.</span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It would be interesting also to know whether the X-ray of his lungs, taken immediately following the accident, shows this </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page309" class="pagebreak" title="309">309</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">dilatation or not. If it was not present immediately following the accident and is now present, then we could be sure that it came out of the accident.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Prior to the negotiations for settlement, the contents of the above report were made known to counsel for defendants Florian and John Ledermann.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The case was called for trial on March 4, 1957, at which time the respective parties and their counsel possessed such information as to David’s physical condition as was revealed to them by their respective medical examiners as above described. It is thus apparent that neither David nor his father, the nominal plaintiff in the prior action, was then aware that David was suffering the aorta aneurysm but on the contrary believed that he was recovering from the injuries sustained in the accident.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On the following day an agreement for settlement was reached wherein, in consideration of the payment of $6,500, David and his father agreed to settle in full for all claims arising out of the accident. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Early in 1959, David was required by the army reserve, of which he was a member, to have a physical checkup. For this, he again engaged the services of Dr. Cain. In this checkup, the latter discovered the aorta aneurysm. He then reexamined the X-rays which had been taken shortly after the accident and at this time discovered that they disclosed the beginning of the process which produced the aneurysm. He promptly sent David to Dr. Jerome Grismer for an examination and opinion. The latter confirmed the finding of the aorta aneurysm and recommended immediate surgery therefor. This was performed by him at Mount Sinai Hospital in Minneapolis on March 10, 1959.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Shortly thereafter, David, having attained his majority, instituted the present action for additional damages due to the more serious injuries including the aorta aneurysm which he alleges proximately resulted from the accident. As indicated above, the prior order for settlement was vacated. In a memorandum made a part of the order vacating the settlement, the court stated: . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The mistake concerning the existence of the aneurysm was not mutual. For reasons which do not appear, plaintiff’s doctor failed </span>to ascertain its existence. By reason of the failure of plaintiff’s counsel to use available rules of discovery, plaintiff’s doctor and all his representatives did not learn that defendants and their agents knew of its existence and possible serious consequences. Except for the character of the concealment in the light of plaintiff’s minority, the Court would, I believe, be justified in denying plaintiff’s motion to vacate, leaving him to whatever questionable remedy he may have against his doctor and against his lawyer.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page310" class="pagebreak" title="310">310</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">That defendants’ counsel concealed the knowledge they had is not disputed. The essence of the application of the above rule is the character of the concealment. Was it done under circumstances that defendants must be charged with knowledge that plaintiff did not know of the injury? If so, an enriching advantage was gained for defendants at plaintiff’s expense. There is no doubt of the good faith of both defendants’ counsel. There is no doubt that during the course of the negotiations, when the parties were in an adversary relationship, no rule required or duty rested upon defendants or their representatives to disclose this knowledge. However, once the agreement to settle was reached, it is difficult to characterize the parties’ relationship as adverse. At this point all parties were interested in securing Court approval. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But it is not possible to escape the inference that defendants’ representatives knew, or must be here charged with knowing, that plaintiff under all the circumstances would not accept the sum of $6500.00 if he or his representatives knew of the aneurysm and its possible serious consequences. Moreover, there is no showing by defendants that would support an inference that plaintiff and his representatives knew of the existence of the aneurysm but concluded that it was not causally related to the accident.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">When the adversary nature of the negotiations concluded in a settlement, the procedure took on the posture of a joint application to the Court, at least so far as the facts upon which the Court could and must approve settlement is concerned. It is here that the true nature of the concealment appears, and defendants’ failure to act affirmatively, after having been given a copy of the application for approval, can only be defendants’ decision to take a calculated risk that the settlement would be final . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To hold that the concealment was not of such character as to result in an unconscionable advantage over plaintiff’s ignorance or mistake, would be to penalize innocence and incompetence and reward less than full performance of an officer of the Court’s duty to make full disclosure to the Court when applying for approval in minor settlement proceedings.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">[I]n the instant case the court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the settlement which it had approved on plaintiff’s behalf while he was still a minor. It is undisputed that neither he nor his counsel nor his medical attendants were aware that at the time settlement was made he was suffering from an aorta aneurysm which may have resulted from the accident. The seriousness of this disability is indicated by Dr. Hannah’s report indicating the imminent danger of death therefrom. This was </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page311" class="pagebreak" title="311">311</span><span style="color: #000000;">known by counsel for both defendants but was not disclosed to the court at the time it was petitioned to approve the settlement. While no canon of ethics or legal obligation may have required them to inform plaintiff or his counsel with respect thereto, or to advise the court therein, it did become obvious to them at the time, that the settlement then made did not contemplate or take into consideration the disability described. This fact opened the way for the court to later exercise its discretion in vacating the settlement and under the circumstances described we cannot say that there was any abuse of discretion on the part of the court in so doing</span>. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Spaulding v. Zimmerman</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the district court insisted (and the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed) that, during adversary settlement negotiations, “no rule required or duty rested upon defendants or their representatives” to disclose that David Spaulding suffered from an aortic aneurysm. What is your view? Did defense counsel have a moral duty to provide that information?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider Rule 1.6(b)(1)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)(1)&quot; " /></span><span style="color: #000000;">, explored in more detail in Section G.1, </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">infra</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Rule 1.6(b)(1) permits a lawyer to disclose client confidences “to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.” Was David Spaulding’s impending death or substantial bodily harm “reasonably certain”? According to a 2003 study, the annual probability of rupture in an aortic aneurism of 5</span>–<span style="color: #000000;">5.9 centimeters is 1 percent; the probability for an aneurism of six centimeters or more is 14 percent.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.704" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.704" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> Put differently, the odds that David Spaulding’s aneurism would rupture some time before he turned forty-five was 21 percent for the smaller aneurism and 97 percent if the aneurism was six centimeters. Would Rule 1.6(b)(1) permit defense counsel to inform Spaulding of his condition? Should the numerical data matter in a lawyer’s decision about whether to warn Spaulding about his aneurism?</span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The district judge vacated the settlement on the theory that, once the parties were before the court to seek the court’s acceptance of the settlement, they were no longer in an adversary posture, and “[i]t is here that the true nature of the concealment appears.” Is the implication that although defendants’ counsel had no duty to save Spaulding’s life, they </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">did</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> have a duty not to mislead the trial judge? How does that make sense? Is it true that lawyers have an obligation to reveal all relevant facts about a case, including confidential information, when presenting an out-of-court settlement to the judge for approval? </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to the district judge: “[T]here is no doubt of the good faith of both defendants’ counsel.” Do you agree? What does good faith mean in this context? Is it relevant (or disturbing) that, according to a later interview with </span>

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The court reserves its criticism for Spaulding’s lawyer, who failed “to use available rules of discovery” to obtain the medical reports of defendants’ physician. Only the fact that Spaulding was a minor prevented the judge from “denying plaintiff’s motion to vacate, leaving him to whatever questionable remedy he may have against his doctor and against his lawyer.” In your view, does the fault lie more with plaintiff’s counsel than with defendants’? Should the result of the case have depended on the plaintiff’s age?</span>
      </p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In their case history of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Spaulding v. Zimmerman</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, Roger C. Cramton and Lori P. Knowles interviewed the surviving participants of the litigation and reviewed court records. Cramton and Knowles found that the two defense lawyers never informed their clients about Spaulding’s aneurysm; indeed, they appear to have made the decision not to disclose the information entirely on their own, without consulting either their clients or the insurers who were paying their fee.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.706" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.706" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> What might account for such conduct?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Cramton and Knowles also shed light on one of the puzzling features of the case—the failure on the part of Spaulding’s lawyer to request Dr. Hannah’s report. In part, this lapse may be attributable to the lawyer’s youth and inexperience, but he also had a legitimate worry about demanding the report. He feared that it might lead defense counsel to request reports by Spaulding’s physicians, one of which recommended waiting a year to settle the case in order to make sure of the extent of Spaulding’s injuries. Spaulding’s lawyer feared that if this report came to light, the court might not approve the immediate settlement that all parties desired.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        <span style="color: #000000;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The story does not have a happy ending. Although David Spaulding’s aortic aneurysm was discovered in time for corrective surgery, a side-effect of the surgery was that David lost the power of speech. Not all the lawyers lived happily ever after, either. Richard Pemberton, a young lawyer who argued the case for defendant Zimmerman in the Minnesota Supreme Court, believed that he received the assignment because a senior partner found it distasteful. Pemberton did as well and subsequently had this to say about his assignment:</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted above, the current Rule 1.6(b)(1)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)(1)&quot; " />—adopted in 2002—permits disclosure of client confidences when the lawyer “reasonably believes” that disclosure is necessary to prevent “reasonably certain” death or substantial bodily harm. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Not all states march lockstep with the Model Rule, however. Some states require that the harm be the result of the client’s conduct.<a id="_Ref33194645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.709" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.709" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> (The current Model Rules contain no such requirement.) Some states, including California, permit disclosure only if the death or substantial bodily harm would result from a client’s <span style="font-style: italic;">criminal</span> act.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.710" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.710" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span> Others permit disclosure if the client’s act was either criminal or fraudulent. Thus, Connecticut permits disclosure of client confidences to the extent “necessary to prevent the client from committing a criminal <span style="font-style: italic;">or fraudulent</span> act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.711" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.711" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Meanwhile, Rhode Island and South Dakota have retained the Model Rules’ pre-2002 limitation (requiring that the harm be “imminent”).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.712" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.712" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> To understand the significance of imminence, consider a hypothetical case in which the threatened death or bodily harm arises from a slow-acting toxic chemical. In such a case, the death or bodily harm would not be imminent, and the lawyer would have no authority to reveal client confidences to forestall it. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Spaulding v. Zimmerman</span>, the limitation to imminent death or bodily injury might foreclose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page314" class="pagebreak" title="314">314</span>Zimmerman’s lawyers from revealing Spaulding’s aneurism, which might not rupture for many years. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Would the result be different with “imminent” replaced by Model Rule 1.6(b)(1)’s “reasonably certain”? Comment 6 to the Rule explains that “harm is reasonably certain to occur if it will be suffered imminently or if there is a present and substantial threat that a person will suffer such harm at a later date if the lawyer fails to take action necessary to eliminate the threat.” The Comment continues: “Thus, a lawyer who knows that a client has accidentally discharged toxic waste into a town’s water supply may reveal this information to the authorities if there is a present and substantial risk that a person who drinks the water will contract a life-threatening or debilitating disease and the lawyer’s disclosure is necessary to eliminate the threat or reduce the number of victims.” <a id="dabmci_03d0f3b976eb48a890a3c241a6af2edc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Alaska and Massachusetts permit lawyers to reveal client confidences in order to prevent the wrongful execution or incarceration of another person. This exception clarifies that the permission to reveal confidences to prevent death includes death by execution. It also addresses an excruciating moral dilemma that lawyers face when they know that an innocent person is going to prison (or is going to be executed) for a crime that someone else—perhaps the client—committed.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.713" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.713" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Somewhat surprisingly, many defense lawyers oppose the exception, arguing that instances in which the provision applies are rare and, even under the current system, are typically adequately resolved (often, because the existing rules permit disclosure with the client’s informed consent). Some defense lawyers also fear that the amendment would dilute the attorney-client privilege and Rule 1.6, and they worry that the exception threatens to undermine the attorney-client relationship, to the extent the attorney would have to explain the exception to the client, at the start of the representation.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.714" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.714" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Weighing the costs and benefits of such a provision, would you support such an amendment to the Rules?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Others suggest that, even without a clear exception, the Model Rules may already permit such disclosures because: “If the daily life of the wrongly incarcerated is producing ‘reasonably certain . . . substantial bodily harm,’ <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page315" class="pagebreak" title="315">315</span>then the lawyer may reveal the client information necessary to prevent it.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.715" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.715" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> What do you make of that argument?

      <p class="TextParagraph">Some of the most common, and therefore troubling, confidentiality dilemmas arise out of client fraud. As Geoffrey Hazard puts it: “Responsible law-giving require[s] recognition . . . that honest lawyers can suffer the misfortune of having dishonest clients.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.716" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.716" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span> Hazard cautions that lawyers representing such clients risk criminal sanctions for aiding and abetting fraud if the lawyers protect client confidences too zealously.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.717" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.717" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> Some lawyers seem to believe that the attorney-client relationship insulates them from criminal or civil liability for crimes and frauds involving their professional assistance. This is simply not so.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It was not until 2003 that the ABA’s Model Rules permitted lawyers to divulge client confidences (a) to prevent client crime or fraud; or (b) to rectify client fraud in which lawyers had unwittingly participated. Remarkably, however, by that time, all but eight states and the District of Columbia had already abandoned the Model Rules’ across-the-board protection of confidences concerning client fraud. After the ABA acted, the remaining states adopted one or both of the proposed permissions to divulge confidences; some even strengthened them to <span style="font-style: italic;">require</span> disclosure.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Required disclosure.</span> Florida, New Jersey, Virginia, and Wisconsin require lawyers to disclose confidential information to prevent certain client crimes; Hawaii, New Jersey, and Wisconsin also require the lawyer to disclose such information to prevent a non-criminal fraud that will cause “substantial injury” to another’s financial interests or property (in Hawaii, only if the lawyer’s services were used in perpetrating the fraud).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Prohibited disclosure.</span> Only Alabama, California, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and South Dakota forbid the disclosure of confidences to prevent criminal conduct (unless it threatens life or limb, or in some cases threatens the integrity of judicial process).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Permitted disclosure. </span>Other states have a variety of rules permitting the disclosure of confidences to prevent criminal or non-criminal frauds or to rectify frauds in which the lawyer’s services were used. Similarly, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement </span>§ 67 permits lawyers to disclose confidences to prevent or rectify client crime or fraud threatening “substantial financial loss,” if the lawyer’s services are being used in the same matter.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page316" class="pagebreak" title="316">316</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These state responses recognize that, as Hazard puts it:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[A]n honest lawyer with a dishonest client is at risk of being drawn into a transaction which is tainted with fraud or other illegality; that in such an eventuality the lawyer can be charged with being an accessory to the client’s wrongdoing; that honest lawyers should be able effectively to disengage themselves from client fraud; and that being able to effect such a disengagement requires clear legal authority to disclose client confidences if necessary to that purpose. [Responsible law-giving] also requires having no tears for clients who draw their lawyers into fraudulent schemes.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.718" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.718" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In every decade from the 1970s through the 2000s, at least one notorious case involved lawyers who, by honoring the duty of confidentiality, permitted clients to engage in fraud; the names of these scandals have become shorthand for the entire problem and the debates surrounding them. The 1970s saw lawyers investigated for their role in a stock market fraud involving the National Student Marketing Corporation. In the 1980s the case involved lawyers representing the computer leasing firm O.P.M., which was, in reality, a Ponzi scheme. What some called “<span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> ethics case of the ’90s” implicated the Wall Street law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler in their client’s financial services fraud, and for some time “Kaye, Scholer” displaced O.P.M. as the quintessential client fraud case. After 2001, the case was “Enron.” Below, we briefly relate the history of these episodes.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">National Student Marketing involved an SEC enforcement action that charged lawyers with aiding and abetting client fraud by sitting silently in a meeting while their clients committed misdeeds.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.719" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.719" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The O.P.M. case (described in detail in Problem 3, <span style="font-style: italic;">infra</span>) involved a law firm closing deals for crooked clients, even after the firm learned that earlier deals it had closed were fraudulent. The O.P.M. story broke in 1981, while an ABA Commission was drafting the Model Rules. Several influential members of the Commission favored broader exceptions to confidentiality, and O.P.M. became a poster child for the perils of rules that outlaw disclosure. Early drafts of the Model Rules included exceptions to confidentiality if disclosure was the only way for lawyers to prevent such fraud or rectify frauds that they had unwittingly assisted. But the bar objected and the ABA (for a long time) rejected those exceptions.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.720" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.720" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Kaye, Scholer case arose out of the collapse of the savings and loan industry (the so-called “thrift industry”) in the late 1980s, which cost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page317" class="pagebreak" title="317">317</span>taxpayers an estimated half-a-trillion dollars because the thrifts were federally insured. One of the most notorious of the thrift owners, Charles Keating, retained Kaye, Scholer to help fight off bank examiners whose job was to make sure that thrifts were run prudently. Kaye, Scholer’s lawyers informed the bank examiners—who were entitled by law to full access to the thrift’s records—that all requests for information were to be channeled through the law firm. Then the firm allegedly stonewalled the examiners. The upshot was: At the same time the firm was publicly asserting that Keating’s Lincoln Savings and Loan was making sound, prudent investments, the thrift was actually involved in fraudulent and high-risk transactions that put it in a deep financial hole.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)—a government agency charged with recovering as much money as possible from the savings and loan mess—ultimately took Lincoln over as its receiver. Suddenly, Kaye, Scholer’s adversary had become the client, and the attorney-client privilege no longer shielded Lincoln’s records. Based on its review of Lincoln’s files, OTS initiated charges against the law firm for misrepresentation and concealment. Without conceding fault, the firm settled for $41 million. In a widely-quoted judicial opinion, federal judge Stanley Sporkin blasted the lawyers and accountants who worked for Keating:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The questions that must be asked are: Where were these professionals . . . when these clearly improper transactions were being consummated? Why didn’t any of them speak up or disassociate themselves from these transactions? Where also were the outside accountants and attorneys when these transactions were effectuated? What is difficult to understand is that with all the professional talent involved (both accounting and legal), why at least one professional would not have blown the whistle to stop the overreaching that took place in this case.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.721" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.721" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Then, in 2001, Enron came to the fore. The energy company’s manipulation consisted of extremely intricate transactions designed to move losses off Enron’s books and onto the books of “special purpose entities” that were nominally independent but that were actually created for no purpose other than parking losses. All of these transactions involved many professionals: executives, accountants, and lawyers. Enron’s in-house legal department consisted of 250 attorneys—and at least two outside law firms (Vinson &amp; Elkins and Andrews &amp; Kurth) played a substantial role in papering Enron’s deals. No single set of events as dramatic as the O.P.M. or Kaye, Scholer cases emerged from lawyers’ behavior.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.722" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.722" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> But a lengthy report by a court-appointed bankruptcy examiner suggested that the lawyers’ failure to blow the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page318" class="pagebreak" title="318">318</span>whistle (internally as well as externally) created ground for malpractice actions.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.723" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.723" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span> Vinson &amp; Elkins settled lawsuits for $30 million.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.724" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.724" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These are not isolated cases. A survey by the New York City Bar examining nine scandals found that in at least seven lawyers were well positioned to ask questions about the conduct leading to the litigation, and in one of the two exceptions, lawyers knew of other violations of fiduciary obligations.<a id="_Ref33194763" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.725" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.725" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span> Litigation over lawyers’ responsibilities in such cases of client fraud is likely to remain a prominent feature of the contemporary legal landscape. Underlying all of these cases are fundamental problems of adversarial ethics. What, if any, obligations do lawyers have to protect innocent third parties from unscrupulous clients? What obligations do lawyers owe to a client’s shareholders, whose interests might be jeopardized by managerial misconduct? How are those responsibilities to be balanced against the duty of confidentiality?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If you suspect that your client is involved in fraudulent or hazardous conduct, can you keep your hands clean by keeping your eyes closed? Under what circumstances might you have an obligation to investigate your client’s activities? Under what circumstances might you have an obligation to report managerial misconduct to a board of directors? See the discussion of organizational clients, Rule 1.13, and the Sarbanes-Oxley statute in Chapter 11.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Many business lawyers deny that they have any responsibilities to investigate potential client misconduct, but there is distinguished judicial authority to the contrary.

Proud, wrote a letter assuring a would-be lender that no prior liens existed on the collateral that Proud’s client was putting up for a loan. Proud relied on his client’s statement that no liens existed under circumstances that plainly suggested a need for further inquiry. The client was lying, and after he had defaulted on the loan, the court imposed substantial civil liability on Proud for “negligent misrepresentations that induce detrimental reliance.” <a id="dabmci_1632a5aa705b41678db6a2800df2887c" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />26 F.2d at 1565.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">sham transactions and dodge SEC regulations. The court refused to countenance the “conscious avoidance of ethical duties.” Other cases similarly find that attorneys can be liable under securities law if they are reckless in not knowing that a client’s conduct is fraudulent.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The above cases would suggest that, to avoid liability, it is not necessarily enough for a lawyer simply to accept at face value a client’s assurances about the propriety of a transaction or the soundness of the client’s business—and that, if you reasonably suspect that your client is concealing material facts, you cannot adopt a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to client interviewing.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The Rules tend to support this interpretation. In general, the Rules require actual knowledge of client misconduct in order to trigger any ethical obligations. </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">See</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Rule 1.0(f). But that knowledge may be inferred from circumstances, and occasionally courts and ethics committee have refused to absolve lawyers for closing their eyes to client misconduct.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Comment 3 to Rule 1.13 similarly provides that “a lawyer cannot ignore the obvious.”</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When a regulatory agency requires corporations to disclose information, how adversarial may lawyers be in fending off regulators? This issue played a prominent role in the Kaye, Scholer matter. Noted legal ethicist Geoffrey Hazard gave an expert opinion on behalf of Kaye, Scholer maintaining that the firm was acting in the traditional role of litigation counsel in administrative or judicial proceedings that Lincoln reasonably anticipated. That role, he suggested, is one in which the lawyer’s obligations to third parties are at a minimum and obligations of confidentiality and zealous advocacy are at a maximum. According to Hazard, the standard governing what litigation counsel can say on behalf of their clients is set forth in Model Rule 3.1. This rule requires only that lawyers have a non-frivolous basis for any position that they assert. Under this standard, Hazard argued, Kaye, Scholer had behaved properly.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.728" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.728" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Another ethics expert, William H. Simon, took issue with Hazard’s position. In particular, Simon rejected the view that the ethical obligations of “litigation counsel” are only to refrain from taking frivolous positions:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Professional responsibility doctrine provides no support for this position whether or not we call the lawyers “litigation counsel.” The argument’s spurious force depends entirely on its disregard for the distinction between factual assertion and argument. Rule 3.1 and its “not frivolous” standard applies to the latter; it governs </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">positions</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> that counsel takes, not assertions containing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">information</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. In a pleading, brief, or argument in court, the lawyer refers to evidence that has been or will be presented to the tribunal. Argument involves assertions as to how this evidence should be interpreted or </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page320" class="pagebreak" title="320">320</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">characterized. . . . The dangers of deception are limited, and counsel can be given wide latitude. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The situation is different if the lawyer provides information, especially under a disclosure duty. . . . In these situations, counsel’s task does not consist of suggesting characterizations for evidence of record but rather of providing information within their control in response to the other party’s requests. When counsel represent expressly or implicitly that they have provided all the information responsive to the request, they put their credibility in issue in ways that they do not in argument.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">What is your view? Is a lawyer reporting client information to a regulatory agency like litigation counsel, and thus subject to the norms of the adversary system, or do regulatory contexts call for less spin and more candor?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some commentators draw a distinction between </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">gatekeeping</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> and </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">whistleblowing</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> rules. A gatekeeping rule, such as Rule 1.2(d), prohibits lawyers from assisting in fraudulent conduct. Coupled with Rule 1.16(a), this gatekeeping rule requires lawyers to withdraw from representations whenever their involvement would further a client crime or fraud. If lawyers are essential to the transaction, their refusal to provide assistance “shuts the gate” before it can be completed. Another example of a gatekeeping rule is the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery &amp; Enforcement Act (FIRREA), which makes banking attorneys liable for large civil penalties and restitution payments if they knowingly or recklessly participate in violations of law, fiduciary duty, or unsafe and unsound banking practice.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> A whistleblowing rule goes further. Not only must lawyers refuse to assist a crime or fraud, they must (or may) inform others of the misconduct, or divulge weaknesses in the client’s financial position.</span>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In arguing against gatekeeping and whistleblowing requirements, some lawyers strongly object to being forced to police their clients. They often claim that it is unfair to mandate a standard of behavior that will be impossible to enforce and that less scrupulous members of the bar will not honor. The </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">A related argument, developed by the New York City Bar, is that lawyers who have gatekeeping or whistleblowing obligations will be excluded from information channels, and may let their own concerns about avoiding liability skew their advice to clients.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> How should this risk be balanced against the benefits of increasing lawyer’s responsibilities to investigate and prevent possible misconduct? To what extent should lawyers be asked to play gatekeeping and whistleblowing roles?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Investigators of business frauds sometimes report that the lawyers they interview are stunned to discover that the deals they worked on were fraudulent. Enron lawyers told investigators that they were proud of the cutting-edge deals they put together; somehow, they failed to recognize that the deals were illegal. Social psychology research suggests common patterns that may work against lawyers’ recognition of client misconduct. One such tendency is “cognitive conservatism.” Individuals are more likely to register and retain information when it is compatible with established beliefs or earlier decisions. A related phenomenon is reduction of “cognitive dissonance.” After making a decision, individuals tend to suppress or re-construe information that casts doubt on that decision. Accordingly, once lawyers have determined to represent a particular client, they may become less sensitive to ethical problems arising from that choice.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Other problems involve overconfidence and over-commitment. Those who obtain decisionmaking positions often have high confidence in their own capacities and judgment. That can readily lead to arrogance, over-optimism, and an escalation of commitment to choices that turn out to be wrong, either factually or morally. As a result, individuals may ignore or suppress dissent, overestimate their ability to rectify adverse consequences, and cover up mistakes by denying, withholding, or sometimes destroying information. An incremental slide into ever more dubious conduct can readily produce “the boiled frog” problem. As legend would have it, a frog thrown into boiling </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Other cognitive processes push in similar directions. Individuals are more likely to retain information that reflects favorably on themselves and to form positive impressions of someone on whom their own success partly depends. So too, the very act of advocating a particular position increases the likelihood that proponents will themselves come to adopt that position. In many practice settings, these cognitive biases, together with financial self-interest, collegial pressure, and diffusion of responsibility skew ethical judgment.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">How should ethical codes and civil liability rules respond to these psychological tendencies?

      <p class="TextParagraph">Assume that you were a senior partner with Singer, Hutner, Levine &amp; Seeman under the circumstances in the O.P.M. case described briefly above and in more detail below. What would you have done?<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.738" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.738" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">O.P.M., a computer leasing firm in the era before personal computers, obtained more than $210 million in fraudulent loans (the equivalent of $600 million in 2019 dollars). With those sizable loans, the two partners who owned O.P.M. bought computers that they then leased to other companies. Then, they used their existing leases as collateral for loans needed to buy additional computers. O.P.M. won a sizable market share by slashing its prices, but as a result, its revenues were too small to provide collateral for the new loans the partners needed. So the partners forged fake leases for much higher amounts—leases that their lawyers unknowingly presented to lenders as documentation. Every increase in their business required new computers, new loans, and new forgeries; incoming revenues went to service past loans. In essence, O.P.M. (the initials stood for <span style="font-style: italic;">O</span>ther <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span>eople’s <span style="font-style: italic;">M</span>oney) was a pyramid scheme.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most of these loans were negotiated and the paperwork processed by O.P.M.’s outside counsel, the law firm of Singer, Hutner, Levine &amp; Seeman. A year before the two partners who ran O.P.M. were finally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page323" class="pagebreak" title="323">323</span>caught, their accountant warned Singer Hutner of the frauds. At this point, O.P.M. was generating 60 percent of the firm’s billings.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What should the firm have done at this point?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Singer Hutner engaged two legal ethics experts as consultants. On the basis of their advice, Singer Hutner continued to close new loans for O.P.M. A few months later, it became clear to Singer Hutner, partly as a result of one O.P.M. partner’s admissions, that $60 million of the new loans it had closed were fraudulent. What should the firm have done as soon as that information came to light?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />On advice of the legal ethics experts, Singer Hutner gradually terminated its representation without informing O.P.M.’s new counsel that anything was amiss. Before the fraud finally unraveled, the new attorneys had unwittingly closed another $15 million in fraudulent loans for O.P.M. After the O.P.M. partners were convicted and sentenced to ten and twelve years in prison, Singer Hutner paid $10 million to settle a suit brought by defrauded lenders.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.739" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.739" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What accounts for the law firm’s behavior? When Singer Hutner lawyers first learned of the frauds, they told their ethics consultants that the firm wanted to do what was proper but also wished, if possible, to continue representing O.P.M., its bread-and-butter client. In response, the consultants gave three crucial pieces of advice. First, because the frauds were past, Singer Hutner could not disclose them. Second, Singer Hutner had no obligation to “police” its client in order to make certain that the new loans it was closing were honest. Third, because Singer Hutner had no information positively suggesting that O.P.M.’s partners would continue the frauds (and the partners fervently assured the lawyers that they would not), the firm did not have to withdraw. How would you evaluate this advice based on today’s Rules?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although Singer Hutner eventually insisted that the O.P.M. partners arrange to have customers send the law firm independent verifications of deals, the O.P.M. partners had little difficulty intercepting the verification forms and substituting forgeries.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When, several months later, Singer Hutner partners discovered that they had closed an additional $60 million in fraudulent new loans, the ethics consultants advised that these too had now become past frauds, and were therefore protected by the bar’s confidentiality rules. When Singer Hutner decided to withdraw, the consultants warned that a sudden resignation could violate the firm’s ethical responsibilities under the version of New York’s rules then in force: “A lawyer shall not withdraw from employment until he has taken reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of his client.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.740" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.740" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> It followed from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page324" class="pagebreak" title="324">324</span>consultants’ opinion that Singer Hutner could not reveal O.P.M.’s past frauds to successor counsel, even though the new counsel asked whether anything was amiss. Thus, Singer Hutner’s lawyers found themselves in the painful position of deceiving their successor counsel, who then closed additional fraudulent transactions.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.741" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.741" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">f)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Singer Hutner lawyers claimed that, at no point in the O.P.M. history, did they clearly “know” that the loans it was closing were fraudulent. Do you find this excuse adequate? If the only way that Singer Hutner could have known about the loans it was closing was to police its own client, what should the firm have done?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">g)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At what step, if any, did Singer Hutner go wrong? Why? Would Rules giving lawyers the discretion but not the obligation to reveal frauds have made a difference? If not, what else might have been more effective?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">It should be obvious that lawyers who face ethical dilemmas often need advice. Until the Model Rules’ 2002 revisions, however, there was no exception to confidentiality that would allow lawyers to seek advice outside their own law firms. The ABA rectified this omission by adding an exception in Rule 1.6(b)(4)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(4)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(4)&quot; \c 16 " /> “to secure legal advice about the lawyer’s compliance with these Rules.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Another exception to confidentiality to enhance rule compliance was approved by the ABA in 2012. Now, Rule 1.6(b)(7)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(7)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(7)&quot; \c 16 " /> permits lawyers to reveal confidences in order “to detect and resolve conflicts of interest” when lawyers change jobs or restructure law firms. The Rule does not permit lawyers to reveal confidences if doing so might waive the attorney-client privilege “or otherwise prejudice the client.” Some ABA delegates objected that revealing confidences would be improper without client consent. The majority, however, accepted arguments that a client consent requirement would place young lawyers in an untenable position: They would not be able to look for a new job without informing their current employer that they were doing so.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.742" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.742" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">One conspicuous exception to the bar’s passionate defense of confidentiality arises when a client sues a lawyer or files a grievance against a lawyer, or when a lawyer must sue a client to collect unpaid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page325" class="pagebreak" title="325">325</span>fees. The Rules provide, in such circumstances, that confidentiality may give way. Specifically, Rule 1.6(b)(5)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(5)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(5)&quot; \c 16 " /> provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary . . . </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(5)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer’s representation of the client.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Comment 10 to Rule 1.6 explains:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The lawyer’s right to respond arises when an assertion of such complicity has been made. Paragraph (b)(5) does not require the lawyer to await the commencement of an action or proceeding that charges such complicity, so that the defense may be established by responding directly to a third party who has made such an assertion. The right to defend also applies, of course, where a proceeding has been commenced.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">In other words, lawyers may reveal client confidences preemptively when a third party accuses them of complicity in client wrongdoing. Is that line-drawing justified? Should the lawyer at least have to wait until a proceeding has commenced?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some have criticized the discrepancy between the bar’s otherwise-wholehearted embrace of confidentiality and the self-defense exception:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The same lawyer who is prohibited from disclosing information learned while representing a client to exonerate someone falsely accused of a capital crime, in other words, is perfectly free to disclose confidential information when he or she is the one accused, falsely or not. Nor is there any requirement that the lawyer’s liberty be at stake, or even that the lawyer be accused of anything criminal. A simple fee dispute with a client is sufficient grounds to disclose confidential information. The lawyer’s interest in collecting a fee is apparently a higher priority than exonerating an innocent defendant about to be convicted of a capital crime or helping a distraught family locate an abducted child. Confidentiality means everything in legal ethics unless lawyers lose money, in which case it means nothing.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.743" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.743" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Are the bar’s priorities sensible?

Absent informed consent of the client to do otherwise, the lawyer should assert on behalf of the client all nonfrivolous claims that the order is not authorized by other law or that the information sought is protected against <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page327" class="pagebreak" title="327">327</span>disclosure by the attorney-client privilege or other applicable law. In the event of an adverse ruling, the lawyer must consult with the client about the possibility of appeal to the extent required by Rule 1.4. Unless review is sought, however, paragraph (b)(6) permits the lawyer to comply with the court’s order.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Surprisingly, it was not always thus. An early draft of the Model Rules included a provision permitting lawyers to reveal confidences in order to comply with a court order. But the ABA House of Delegates rejected the provision, which was not restored until 2002—nearly twenty years later. In the intervening decades, lawyers and commentators searching for a way to allow lawyers to comply with court orders without violating Rule 1.6 argued that complying with court orders fell under the rubric of “disclosure . . . impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation” (Rule 1.6(a)). Because the prohibition was circumvented, the deletion’s significance was more symbolic than practical—but the symbolism is important. It shows how profoundly reluctant the bar has been to permit disclosure—even when a court declares that the information has to be revealed.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Part of the fallout from the Enron affair and other accounting scandals in the early 2000s was the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a tough financial regulatory statute. Among other requirements, Sarbanes-Oxley imposed requirements on lawyers to report potential illegal activity by clients. (This is treated in detail in Chapter 11, Section A, <span style="font-style: italic;">infra</span>.) To bring the Rules into alignment with Sarbanes-Oxley’s requirements, the ABA amended Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.13&quot; \s &quot;1.13&quot; \c 16 " />1.13—governing lawyers’ responsibilities when the client is an organization—to permit lawyers to disclose information, even when doing so would otherwise violate Rule 1.6. The amended Rule 1.13 permits a lawyer for an organization to disclose confidential information if:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The lawyer knows that someone in the organization is acting or intends to act unlawfully; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the unlawful act might be imputed to the organization; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the lawyer’s efforts to remedy the problem, including reporting it to the highest authority in the organization, are unavailing; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />“the lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization” (Rule 1.13(c)(2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.13(c)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.13(c)(2)&quot; \c 16 " />).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.749" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.749" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">137</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">If all four conditions are met, the lawyer may reveal confidential information “to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page328" class="pagebreak" title="328">328</span>prevent substantial injury to the organization.” Rule 1.13(c)(2). Earlier versions of this Rule did not permit lawyers to reveal confidences; instead, they merely permitted lawyers to resign.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Note that Rule 1.13 differs significantly from 1.6(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)&quot; \c 16 " />. The latter permits some adverse disclosures—it permits limited disclosures <span style="font-style: italic;">despite</span> the attorney’s duty of loyalty to the client. In contrast, Rule 1.13<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13&quot; " /> permits what some call “loyal disclosures.” In Rule 1.13, disclosure is justified <span style="font-style: italic;">because of</span> the lawyer’s duty of loyalty to the organizational client; the lawyer must speak in order to shield the client-organization from substantial injury. The specific provisions of the two rules highlight this difference: Whereas Rule 1.6(b)(2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(2)&quot; \c 16 " /> and (3)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(3)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(2) and (3)&quot; \c 16 " /> permits disclosure to protect <span style="font-style: italic;">third parties</span> (preventing “substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another”), Rule 1.13(c)(2)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)(2)&quot; " /> permits disclosure only to prevent harm to the <span style="font-style: italic;">client</span> (preventing “substantial injury to the organization”). </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The client-fraud cases we examined above presented a context—the representation of clients in a heavily regulated industry—in which lawyers’ duties of confidentiality were complicated by federal law mandating disclosure of sensitive client information, for example to the SEC or to bank examiners. This is not by any means unusual: The law often creates special disclosure obligations that may affect the lawyer’s professional responsibilities. What this means in practice is that a lawyer’s decisions about when to preserve client confidences may involve the interaction of several different bodies of law. For analytical purposes, we have found it useful to distinguish between the ethical requirement of confidentiality and the law of attorney-client privilege, but in real life, lawyers will have to consider them in tandem, alongside any other bodies of law that bear on disclosure obligations. We conclude this chapter with two problems requiring analysis along these dimensions.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Francis Belge and Frank Armani, New York attorneys, were appointed to defend Robert Garrow on charges of murder. During the course of representation, Garrow revealed to them that he had also committed several rapes and two other unsolved murders. He told them the location of the victims’ bodies. Belge and Armani confirmed the locations and photographed the bodies in the unsolved murders. The lawyers kept this information to themselves, despite the pleas of the frantic parents of the missing murder victims, who correctly surmised that Garrow may have killed their daughters and that Garrow’s attorneys knew one way or the other. The information finally came out ten months later during Garrow’s trial, when Garrow publicly confessed to the rapes and unsolved murders. Belge and Armani hoped to use Garrow’s public confession to help establish an insanity defense. Earlier, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page329" class="pagebreak" title="329">329</span>during secret plea negotiations with the District Attorney, Belge and Armani had suggested that they could provide information concerning two unsolved murders in return for a favorable plea bargain.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Belge and Armani were subsequently indicted for violating two sections of a New York public health law which require, respectively, that a decent burial be accorded to the dead and that anyone knowing of the death of a person without medical attendance report the fact to the proper authorities. After that indictment was dismissed, the New York Bar Association Committee on Professional Ethics was asked to consider whether the lawyers had violated relevant ethics rules.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Problem 4 is based on a case from Syracuse, New York in 1975. In it, Belge and Armani faced an agonizing decision but felt themselves bound by the duty of confidentiality, and they revealed the location of the bodies only when they believed that doing so would be to their client’s advantage. The result was (in the words of Lord Brougham, quoted in Chapter 3) to compound the “alarm” of the community and the “torments” of the victims’ families, but at great “hazards and costs” to the lawyers themselves; their reputations were shattered and their lives were threatened. Was this the proper approach?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In dismissing the indictment against Belge, the New York trial court concluded that the information was privileged and applauded counsel for acting with “all the zeal at [his] command to protect the constitutional rights of his client.” In so holding, the court acknowledged that its task would have been “much more difficult” had Belge been indicted for obstructing justice </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page330" class="pagebreak" title="330">330</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">rather than circumventing the “trivia of a pseudo-criminal statute.” </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">. The appellate court, while affirming dismissal of the indictment, expressly declined to reach the “ethical questions” underlying the case. It did, however, voice “serious concern” as to invocation of the attorney-client privilege in a context where counsel had obligations dictated not only by the applicable ethics rules but by “basic human standards of decency.” </span>

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although a jury convicted Garrow of murder, public sentiment against Belge and Armani ran high. Even before the trial, they received death threats, and afterward their practices encountered severe difficulties. Armani had to dismiss two associates and three secretaries; Belge left for St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.750" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.750" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">138</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Several years after the Garrow case, a television documentary, “Ethics on Trial,” profiled Armani and others involved in the proceedings. The District Attorney who prosecuted Garrow acknowledged that disclosure of the bodies could have led to incriminating information, and defended the decision of Garrow’s counsel to maintain confidentiality. What was “reprehensible,” he believed, was Armani’s and Belge’s attempt to use the information about Garrow’s past crimes to bargain for an insanity plea that would have put the defendant back on the street. This, he maintained, was inconsistent with a lawyer’s role as an officer of the court.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In a television interview, Armani reflected on his dilemma, which he understood in rather different terms than did the District Attorney:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Armani:</span> This was something that was really momentous for us because of the conflict within us. Your mind screaming one way “Relieve these parents [of the murder victims]!” You know—what is your responsibility? Should you report this? Shouldn’t you report it? One sense of morality wants you to relieve the grief.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interviewer:</span> And the other?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Armani:</span> The other is your sworn duty . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interviewer:</span> Didn’t you think that there was a factor of just common decency here?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Armani:</span> I can’t explain it—but to me it was a question of which was the higher moral good.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interviewer:</span> Between what?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Armani:</span> The question of the Constitution, the question of even a bastard like him having a proper defense, having adequate representation, being able to trust his lawyer as to what he says.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Interviewer:</span> As against what?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Armani:</span> As against the fact that I have a dead girl, the fact that her body’s there. As against the breaking hearts of her parents. But they are—[pause]. It’s a terrible thing to play God at that moment, but in my judgment—and I still feel that way—that their suffering <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page331" class="pagebreak" title="331">331</span>is not worth jeopardizing my sworn duty or my oath of office or the Constitution.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.751" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.751" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">139</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />After his conviction on the initial murder charge, Garrow pled guilty to the other offenses in exchange for a concurrent sentence. He then sued Belge and Armani for several million dollars based on allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel, and sued the state for $10 million based on allegedly improper medical treatment of wounds he sustained while being captured by police. In exchange for dropping the claims against the state, he received a transfer to a medium security correctional facility for elderly and handicapped prisoners. The security proved inadequate to his talents and he escaped shortly after his transfer.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The police then asked Armani for any information that might help recapture his former client. According to Armani’s subsequent account of the case, he attempted to</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">recall some of the tactics Garrow had told him about using to elude the police. “He once told me that he would hole up in the underbrush until the cops gave up the search in that area and pulled out. . . . That’s how he broke out of [an earlier police dragnet].”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.752" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.752" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">140</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Based in part on that information, police concentrated search efforts on the underbrush near the prison. As they approached his cover, Garrow fired on the patrol. They fired back, and he was killed instantly.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Did Armani breach any ethical rules in disclosing confidential information about Garrow’s past tactics for eluding police? Was Armani obligated—morally or legally—to volunteer what he knew? What would you have done?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As it turns out, Armani had his own reasons for wanting to make sure Garrow was recaptured. Garrow’s escape terrified him, because of a chilling moment that had occurred during Garrow’s trial. Armani’s wife and his daughter Dorina came to court to watch the trial, and Garrow greeted Dorina by name. Surprised, Armani asked Dorina how she knew Garrow, and she replied that she didn’t. At that moment, Armani realized that at some point, Garrow had been stalking Dorina as he had stalked his other rape and murder victims.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.753" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section16.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.753" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Now, Garrow was loose. Should the risks to Dorina have affected Armani’s disclosure responsibilities?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The New York trial court stated that it might have had difficulty dismissing obstruction of justice charges against the two lawyers. How can keeping a client’s confidences be obstruction of justice? Compare the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Cueto</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> case in Chapter 4. Were Belge’s and Armani’s motives comparable to Cueto’s?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You represent an executive in her divorce. She and her husband have two children, ages four and ten. Currently, your client is romantically involved with another man, Shane. You have negotiated a temporary joint custody arrangement pending the final divorce settlement. For the past few weeks, your client has had sole custody of the children while her husband is out of town making new living arrangements for his elderly mother.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ten days ago, you telephoned your client at home to discuss the ongoing divorce negotiations. Her ten-year-old daughter answered the phone and said that her mother was not home. To your dismay, you learned from her that her mother had left her and her younger sister alone for more than twenty-four hours, while the mother stayed with Shane. You reached your client on her cell phone, and explained to her that leaving small children alone, as she had done, may constitute neglect. Not only could it harm her custody request, neglect is a criminal violation—to say nothing of the danger of leaving the children unaccompanied. Your client explained that the ten-year-old is exceptionally mature and capable, and that she had left meals for the children.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This week, however, you telephoned your client’s home at 7 a.m., hoping to reach her before she left for the day, because she needed to sign some documents. Once again, the ten-year-old answered the telephone and told you that her mother was not there. When you eventually spoke with your client, she explained that she had spent the night caring for Shane, who had flu. She did not bring the children with her because she did not want to expose them to the virus. You warned her that leaving the children unattended is neglect even if her motives were commendable.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Today, you received a call from your client, who informed you that the four-year-old had been treated for minor burns she received while being bathed by her sister. Running the bath, the ten-year-old had turned on the hot water tap before the cold and scalded the younger child. You asked your client bluntly whether she was home at the time. Instead of answering, however, she became angry, and told you to mind your own business. She had called, she said, only to alert you to an incident her husband might raise in the ongoing divorce negotiations—not to get a lecture from her own lawyer about how to live her life.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In your state, child neglect is a misdemeanor punishable by a $1000 fine and/or up to a year in jail. The statute defines criminal neglect as “knowing failure to provide ordinary and proper care and attention” to a child. Furthermore, the state has enacted a Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act. The Act requires any person other than a health practitioner “who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect” to report the evidence to the Department of Child <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page333" class="pagebreak" title="333">333</span>Welfare. However, the Act specifically exempts from this obligation anyone who “would be (a) disclosing matter communicated in confidence by a client to the client’s attorney or other information relating to the representation of the client; or (b) violating the attorney-client privilege.” One more legal rule seems relevant: Unlike the Model Rules, your state permits, but does not require, lawyers to reveal otherwise-confidential information necessary to prevent a client from committing <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> crime. Furthermore, your state’s rule permits disclosure of confidences when necessary to rectify a client crime or fraud in which the lawyer’s services were used.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What are your obligations under the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act? In upcoming settlement negotiations with the husband’s attorney? In future dealings with the court?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What would you do?</p>

It encompasses all “information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client.” DR 4–101(A). Several important jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia and New York state, follow this older rule. The Code protects such categories of information from disclosure to anyone in any setting, apart from the few exceptions noted in DR 4–101(C).</p>

Once that happens, the confidentiality rules do permit disclosure, under Rule 1.6(b)(6), which provides: “A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: . . . to comply with other law or a court order.”</p>

Two innocent boys had been convicted of the crime. The priest urged Fornes to confess; the lawyer convinced him to remain silent.

The lawyer defended his conduct on the grounds that Fornes “was going to throw his whole life away by going to court and saying he did it.” Robert F.

This response ignores the fact that the depth and quality of any investigations to ensure compliance with the law would suffer, even were they undertaken. The response also proves too much, since it applies to all communications covered by the privilege: an individual trying to comply with the law or faced with a legal problem also has strong incentive to disclose information to his lawyer, yet the common law has recognized the value of the privilege in further facilitating communications.</p>
