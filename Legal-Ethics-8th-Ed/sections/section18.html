        <span style="color: #000000;">Introduction</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Among the most familiar roles lawyers play is that of courtroom advocate. This role raises longstanding and sometimes dramatic ethical quandaries. How zealous should lawyers be on behalf of abhorrent causes or clients? What should they do if a client commits perjury? How far can they go to discredit honest, but hostile, witnesses? Should their goal be victory or justice? Such issues can arise in any litigation, civil or criminal. But in the public imagination, criminal cases are the most central and the most controversial. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This chapter explores the above issues. As it does, it pursues two goals: understanding the specific role lawyers play in the criminal justice system, and examining dilemmas of advocacy more generally, including those that are cross-cutting and therefore also arise in non-criminal contexts. It does this in three Parts. Part A explores defense attorney ethics. Part B explores prosecutorial ethics. Then, Part C analyzes ethical issues common to both defense attorneys and prosecutors.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The general public is often ambivalent about the role of criminal defense counsel. As a matter of abstract principle, most people agree that those accused of a crime should be presumed innocent until proven guilty and should have the right to legal assistance. But when the presumption becomes concrete, opinion often shifts. Lawyers’ role in freeing guilty, sometimes dangerous, offenders often provokes considerable outrage. At the same time, however, lawyers’ assistance in protecting those who are unjustly accused accounts for some of the most heroic and widely acclaimed moments in the bar’s history. Criminal cases thus require attorneys to withstand competing pressures and to serve multiple interests. These cases have traditionally served as the paradigm of the advocate’s role because crucial values are at stake on both sides. Interests of life, liberty, and reputation are at issue, not only for defendants, but also for victims, potential victims, and other individuals who might be charged with criminal offenses.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Whether guilty defendants are entitled to zealous advocacy has long been disputed. Back in 1836, in the first American treatise on legal ethics, David Hoffman intoned:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">When employed to defend those charged with crimes of the deepest dye, and the evidence against them, whether legal, or moral, be such as to leave no just doubt of their guilt, I shall not hold myself privileged, much less obliged, to use my endeavours to arrest, or to impede the course of justice, by special resorts to ingenuity—to the artifices of eloquence—to appeals to the morbid and fleeting sympathies of weak juries, or of temporizing courts. . . . Persons of atrocious character, who have violated the law of God and man, are entitled to no such special exertions from any member of our pure and honourable profession; and indeed, to no intervention beyond securing to them a fair and dispassionate investigation of the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">facts</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> of their cause, and the due application of the law: all that goes beyond that, either in manner or substance, is unprofessional, and proceeds, either from a mistaken view of the relation of client and counsel, or from some unworthy and selfish motive, which sets a higher value on professional display and success, than on truth and justice, and the substantial interests of the community.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.868" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.868" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A century later, Supreme Court Justice Byron White defined the obligation of defense counsel very differently:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Law enforcement officers have the obligation to convict the guilty and to make sure they do not convict the innocent. They must be dedicated to making the criminal trial a procedure for the ascertainment of the true facts surrounding the commission of the crime. . . . [Unlike prosecuting attorneys,] defense counsel has no comparable obligation to ascertain or present the truth. Our system assigns him a different mission. He must be and is interested in preventing the conviction of the innocent, but . . . we also insist that he defend his client whether he is innocent or guilty. The State has the obligation to present evidence. Defense counsel need present nothing, even if he knows what the truth is. He need not furnish any witnesses to the police, or reveal any confidences of his client, or furnish any other information to help the prosecution’s case. If he can confuse a witness, even a truthful one, or make him appear at a disadvantage, unsure or indecisive, that will be his normal course. Our interest in not convicting the innocent permits counsel to put the State to its proof, to put the State’s case in </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page387" class="pagebreak" title="387">387</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">the worst possible light, regardless of what he thinks or knows to be the truth. Undoubtedly, there are some limits which defense counsel must observe but more often than not, defense counsel will cross-examine a prosecution witness, and impeach him if he can, even if he thinks the witness is telling the truth, just as he will attempt to destroy a witness who he thinks is lying. In this respect, as part of our modified adversary system and as part of the duty imposed on the most honorable defense counsel, we countenance or require conduct which in many instances has little, if any, relation to the search for truth.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.869" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.869" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A persistent and vital question that confronts criminal defense lawyers is: </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">How can you defend the guilty</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">?</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.870" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.870" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Answers to that question vary. John B. Mitchell, who represented over 600 criminal defendants during the course of his lengthy career, gives one answer: Through defending the guilty, the lawyer can test and ultimately fortify the various constitutional “screens” that protect the innocent. By “screens,” Mitchell refers to the fact that a stop on the street by a police officer cannot be undertaken except with “reasonable suspicion,” an arrest demands “probable cause,” the decision to file charges is made by an independent prosecutor, guilt must be proven “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and the defendant is entitled to a fair appeal.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.871" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.871" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> “[A]t any screen,” Mitchell points out, “the individual may be taken out of the criminal process and returned to the society with as little disruption of his or her life as possible.” These screens, Mitchell insists, are crucial: “[E]ach of these screens functions to protect the values of human dignity and autonomy while enforcing our criminal laws.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.872" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.872" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> But the screens are fragile and not self-enforcing. Without oversight—without a defense lawyer seeking (or obtaining) an acquittal because a screen was bypassed because, for instance, the defendant’s arrest failed to conform to constitutional requirements—the screens will become less protective, ultimately imperiling the innocent. Thus, Mitchell says: “In providing a defense for the guilty . . . the defense attorney also has an effect on the criminal justice system.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.873" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.873" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Mitchell also identifies an educational role: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The defense attorney plays a far broader role than serving as an advocate for a particular criminal defendant; the attorney is also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page388" class="pagebreak" title="388">388</span>the advocate of the ideals and values of our society and legal system. Central to this article is my genuine belief in these fundamental values: It is better that “10 guilty men be freed than a single innocent man be convicted,” and it is perhaps better that “100 guilty men be freed” than to permit the type of intentional government misconduct which appears to permeate our current system. . . . Prosecutors and police are educated about fair and thorough investigation, preparation, and presentation of a case so that the screens will work. Jurors are taught the meaning and importance of their role as well as concepts ranging from abstract principles like “burden of proof” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” to practical wisdom such as the vagaries of eyewitness identifications. The innocent defendant is taught that he can get a fair trial and the guilty are shown that perhaps life can be fairer, and people more just, than he believed.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.874" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.874" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Another classic response is that the “guilty” may not be guilty after all. As Professor Barbara Babcock notes:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Facts are indeterminate, contingent, and in criminal cases, often evanescent. A finding of guilt is not necessarily the truth, but a legal conclusion arrived at after the role of the defense lawyer has been fully played. . . . [T]here is [often] a difference between legal and moral guilt.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.875" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.875" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Many also observe that even the guilty deserve representation, as a contrary rule would mean that guilt would be determined, not in open court, but the privacy of one lawyer’s office. As Lord Erskine observed in the trial of Thomas Paine for publishing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Rights of Man</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> (1792): “If the advocate refuses to defend from what he may think of the charge or the defense, [the lawyer] assumes the character of the judge . . . before the hour of judgment.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.876" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.876" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Others point to the dire conditions of confinement in most of the nation’s prisons, the severe penalties for many offenses, and the disabling consequences of a criminal record. As Mitchell observes: </span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lengthy exposition on the nightmarish conditions in our jails and prisons would cover little new ground. Literature and reports documenting the horrors are extensive. These horrors are not isolated to some crazed southern jail or labor camp, or to a 20th century Bastille in upstate New York called Attica—they exist even in our most affluent state, California. I have seen many of California’s prisons and jails and witnessed the ravages of boredom and the constant fear of violent assault. Over the past 7 years, I have seen inmates who were assaulted and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page389" class="pagebreak" title="389">389</span>tormented by guards, and others who were beaten by members of prison gangs. I have listened to a terrified young man who, sentenced to 45 days in county jail for vehicular manslaughter, sat awake his first night to the sounds of the inmate in the cell to the left of him being sexually assaulted and the old man in the cage to his right having his head slammed against the floor by some younger ones; while the guards just ignored both and busied themselves with paperwork and cups of coffee. I have seen the anger and bitterness build in some, and I have seen the total mental degeneration of others. Worst of all, I have seen the inhuman degradation of their spirit.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I will not dwell on this. Those guilty of serious crimes merit the wrath of our society. But almost no one deserves the hell holes that we call jails and prisons. There is almost no case I would not defend if that meant keeping a human being, as condemnable as he or she may be, from suffering the total, brutal inhumanity of our jails and prisons.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />There remains a sizable gap between public and professional views about defending the guilty. One ABA survey found that over two-thirds of the public believes that “lawyers spend too much time finding technicalities to get criminals released.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.878" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.878" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">What accounts for that perception? Should it be a source of concern?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Are there clients you would not defend, even if no other lawyer were willing to accept the case? In a survey conducted shortly after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, a majority of respondent attorneys indicated that they would not defend accused terrorists.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.879" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.879" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Those who do defend individuals accused of heinous crimes explain their actions in various ways. Some see it as a means of achieving social justice. Others see it as a way to stand up to, and restrict, government power. Others may have felt disregarded in their own lives, or they identify with underdogs. Professor Alan Dershowitz sees it slightly differently: “You are the surgeon in the operating room whose only goal is to save the patient, whether that patient is a good person or a bad person, a saint or a criminal.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.880" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.880" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, Bronx Public Defender David Feige describes the defender’s mindset in this way:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It’s as simple as this: I care about the person I know. In most cases, the complainant is an abstraction to me. His victimization is an abstraction. My client, on the other hand is very human and very real. It is his tears I see, his hand I hold and his mother I </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page390" class="pagebreak" title="390">390</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">console. . . . I empathize with my clients the way everyone else in the system empathizes with the complainants. And ultimately, I do to the complainants what the rest of the system does to my clients. I dehumanize them. I learn their facts and statistics from police reports, but I don’t linger over their faces</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . .</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> “UC #4225 [threatened] with a screwdriver.” That’s the victim. Somewhere behind that language is the person that prosecutors and cops and judges and politicians and friends and family all rally round</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">So defending the reviled, even those who are guilty, is not some mental trick, nor even a moral struggle for me. I don’t lack imagination or willfully close my eyes to another’s suffering. Rather, the reality of my clients—their suffering, their fear—is more vivid to me than that of the victims. My clients are the ones left exposed. They are the ones who are hated. They are the ones who desperately need my protection. Everyone else can look out for the victims.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.881" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.881" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Other accounts of criminal defense lawyers reflect similar strategies of selective empathy—often colored by the view (in the words of another defense lawyer) that: “Almost always, the people we represent are broken</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . .</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> They almost never have the same kinds of benefits that many of us had. To expect them to behave the way people who have all these privileges have is not realistic.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.882" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.882" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> At the same time, other defenders break with Feige in that they insist they are capable of caring deeply about both their client </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">and</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> their client’s victim or victims. “It’s born out of the same empathy.” Both individuals, in some defenders’ eyes, “have at least one thing in common: They’ve been shaped by forces outside of their control.”</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As I reflect upon my experiences as a public defender, I realize that empathy alone did not sustain me. I also felt various motivations that centered around how I envisioned myself and my task. I describe these motivations under the rubric of “heroism.” I saw myself as a kind of “hero” of the oppressed, the one who fights against all odds, a sort of Robin Hood figure who can conquer what others cannot and who does not always have to conform to the moral rules society reserves for others. One element of this “hero” mentality, of course, is the thrill of winning. Certainly, many public defenders are driven in part by a desire to win; at [the District of Columbia Public Defender Service], for example, lawyers with excellent track records of acquittals were regarded with awe. For the public defender, there is glory in the “David versus Goliath” challenge of fighting the state, and the battle of wits that </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page391" class="pagebreak" title="391">391</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">characterizes the courtroom drama only adds to the thrill of the trial. Even the phrase we commonly used to describe a successful defense—“stealing” the case from the prosecution—invoked the image of Robin Hood stealing from the rich and powerful to give to the helpless and weak. Indeed, some people become criminal defenders because they love the challenge, are competitive by nature, and have unusual personal curiosity. They like the idea of representing the underdog, where the scales are tipped against them, the prosecutor has all the resources, and they have virtually none.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">What do you make of the above accounts? Are you persuaded by Mitchell’s notion of screens to protect the innocent?

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Empathy and heroism also may prove counterproductive when taken to the extreme. They may cause the public defender to lose sight of the external moral limitations on her conduct. Empathic feelings, for example, can result in over-identification with the client. Without the benefit of critical distance, a defender may be tempted to overstep ethical boundaries in her zeal to help her client. The same result can occur when a lawyer becomes overly enamored of the “heroic” role—the hero of the oppressed, after all, does not have to play by society’s rules. For example, an overly empathetic or heroic attorney may be inclined to present a perjurious witness if this course of action is likely to win the case.</span>

A zealous defense attorney has a professional obligation to take every legal and ethically permissible step that will serve the client’s best interest—even if the attorney finds the step personally distasteful.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.887" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.887" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> Or, in Professor H.

Is that what you would do if you were assigned to represent a defendant whom you believed to be guilty of a serious and dangerous crime?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Of the criminal defense lawyer’s duty of loyalty, prominent defense lawyer and Georgetown Law Professor Abbe Smith has written: “It is difficult, if not impossible, to zealously represent the criminally accused and simultaneously tend to the feelings of others.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.889" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.889" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> She has further, and more controversially, explained: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">There is nothing unethical about using racial, gender, ethnic, or sexual stereotypes in criminal defense. It is simply an aspect of zealous advocacy. Prejudice exists in the community and in the courthouse, and criminal defense lawyers would be foolhardy not to recognize this as a fact of life. . . . A trial is theater. Defense lawyers cannot afford to be color-blind, gender-blind, or even slightly near-sighted when it comes to race, gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity . . . .<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.890" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.890" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Accordingly, while Smith says she does not “enjoy stirring up or manipulating homophobia or race, gender, or ethnic prejudice in the course of representing a client,” she is willing to do so, if she believes that such a strategy will work to the client’s benefit.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.891" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.891" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Similarly, Timothy Beneke writes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">I try to win my cases. If I could get my client off by appealing to the jury’s sexism I probably would, because I’d be more concerned with this one guy and his freedom than the ethical issue of sexism. If I didn’t appeal to their sexism and I thought I could’ve to get my client off, and he went to prison, I probably would feel pretty bad about it. In the heat of the battle I probably pull out a lot of stops and I may have appealed to the jury’s sexism without even realizing it.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.892" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.892" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Would you be willing to take steps like those proposed by Smith and Beneke in order to protect your clients’ interests? Are such strategies ethical under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? Should they be? What about Model Rule 8.4(g), which prohibits conduct that amounts to harassment or discrimination on the basis of certain characteristics like race and gender?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Lisa Bloom, a lawyer who, like her mother Gloria Allred, specializes in representing women in sexual abuse and harassment cases, represented former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein when he was accused of such conduct. In a confidential December 2016 memo, Bloom offered her services to Weinstein to help him smear actress Rose McGowan, one of his early accusers, by painting her as a “pathological liar.” One of Bloom’s suggested tactics for undermining McGowan: “We can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she’s discredited.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.893" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.893" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> Bloom further boasted to Weinstein that she was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page393" class="pagebreak" title="393">393</span>“equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them” and that such complainants “start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed.” Even after the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> published an explosive article detailing Weinstein’s long history of sexual abuse, Bloom sent an email to the board of directors of Weinstein’s film company denouncing the coverage as “largely false and defamatory,” a “major violation of journalist ethics,” and an account that would quickly be discredited.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.894" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.894" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> In September 2019, McGowan tweeted: “The evil that was perpetrated on me and others was mind bending and illegal. Lisa Bloom should be disbarred.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.895" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.895" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Do you agree? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz was one of the lawyers who helped the serial sexual abuser and supposed billionaire Jeffrey Epstein negotiate a favorable plea deal in 2008. At the time the sweetheart deal was struck, Epstein was facing a fifty-three-page criminal indictment and could have ended up in federal prison for the rest of his life for “assembling a large cult-like network of underage girls” coerced “into having sex acts behind the walls of his opulent waterfront mansion as often as three times a day.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.896" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.896" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> But, as a result of the deal, the FBI’s probe into Epstein’s misconduct was shuttered, Epstein and his accomplices were given broad immunity, and Epstein was required to serve a mere thirteen months in a county jail (though he was allowed to leave the facility during the day).<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.897" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.897" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> In 2019, after the full extent of Epstein’s predatory behavior surfaced and after he committed suicide while awaiting trial on new charges, Dershowitz was asked if he had any regrets about his role in the 2008 plea deal. He replied: </p>

That’s what I will continue to do for the rest of my life. . . . I taught my students for 50 years at Harvard Law School you should always feel bad about producing results like this but it’s your job. The job is to do what you can to help your client and then to feel bad about it.

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” Beginning half-a-century ago, in a series of cases that started with </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, the Supreme Court interpreted this language to hold that an indigent criminal defendant may not be imprisoned, even for a misdemeanor, unless afforded the right to a lawyer’s “effective assistance.”</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Though most lawyers believe that even the patently guilty deserve competent representation, many features of the contemporary criminal justice system seem to conspire to put such representation out of reach. These include: inadequate resources and deficient counsel; criminal defendants’ jaded view of public defenders and court-appointed counsel; and some defense lawyers’ occasional animus or indifference toward their clients. Each is discussed below.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The largest structural challenge to zealous advocacy in the criminal justice setting is inadequate resources—and these paltry resources, too often, contribute to a system of seriously deficient counsel. Reflecting this dynamic, one large survey of indigent criminal cases found that 99 percent included no motion for expenses for experts or investigation.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Today, approximately 80 percent of criminal defendants are poor enough to qualify for court-appointed counsel—and, although systems for indigent defense take several forms, they generally share one defining feature: They are grossly underfunded. Of the $200 billion that America spends annually on criminal justice activities, only 2 percent goes to indigent defense.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Most publicly-funded defense counsel work in one of two ways. Both pose challenges. The first approach is for courts to appoint counsel (who typically have their own private practices) on a case-by-case basis. For this defense work, these appointed lawyers typically receive minimal flat fees or hourly rates, often coupled with a ceiling on total compensation. In some jurisdictions, low ceilings apply even for defendants facing the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">death penalty, and attorneys subject to such compensation caps have ended up with hourly rates below $100. For these court-appointed lawyers, “thorough preparation is a quick route to financial ruin.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Or, as a federal oversight commission candidly put it, due to limited financial resources, most lawyers who take criminal defense cases face an “inherent conflict between remaining financially solvent and providing vigorous advocacy.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Indeed, some lawyers are reportedly appointed </span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> On the other side of the same coin, some lawyers who provide vigorous advocacy for clients in such systems may be stigmatized, admonished, humiliated, and punished for “overworking.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Moreover, many American judges are elected. A judge facing re-election may (consciously or otherwise) favor the lawyer, regardless of ability, who contributes most liberally to the judge’s campaign coffers.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Most experts believe that a full-time defense lawyer, practicing with adequate support staff, should not handle more than 150 felony cases or 400 misdemeanor cases per year.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Even those benchmarks are controversial and seem unrealistic to some: Assuming that the lawyer takes two weeks of vacation per year, handling 150 felony cases a year entails handling a new felony case every 1.6 days—which leaves precious little time for pretrial preparation, fact investigation, or motions practice.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Exacerbating the problems above, it appears that indigent criminal defendants often lack confidence in the defense lawyers appointed to represent their interests. Roy Fleming summarizes these concerns:</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">[C]lients distrust their public defenders and court-appointed attorneys and hold them in low esteem. Jonathan Casper neatly captured their views and caught the tone of subsequent studies with the title of his seminal article, “Did You Have a Lawyer When You Went to Court? No, I Had a Public Defender.” A rather substantial body of research agrees that, in contrast with their attitudes toward privately retained attorneys, criminal defendants see publicly paid and assigned counsel as part of the “system”—overly eager to plead them guilty, disinclined to give them much time, and little concerned about their welfare. . . .</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">In the eyes of criminal clients, professional accountability hinges on a market conception and fee-for-service definition of lawyer responsibility. They place little faith in the notion that ethical concerns and feelings of professional obligation by themselves are sufficient guarantees that a lawyer picked seemingly “out of the hat” will adequately represent their interests.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> public defenders and court-appointed counsel, some ask whether indigent defense systems might be redesigned to allow criminal defendants to select their own attorneys. The idea is that attorney fees and costs would still be paid from state coffers, but defendants could, if they wished, select an attorney from among those who volunteered to represent indigent criminal clients. This possibility has long been considered, but it is now becoming a reality. In 2015, Comal County, Texas, rolled out a pilot program, dubbed “client choice.” Under it, defendants may use government money to select their lawyers, in much the same way that parents in some parts of the country use government vouchers to pay for their child’s education.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Supporters of the program say that it solves two structural problems that generally plague indigent criminal defense. First, lawyers are too often “beholden to judges for appointments,” thus compromising their loyalty. Second, in the traditional system, clients have no meaningful control over attorney selection and—echoing the discussion above—it’s “hard to trust a lawyer you have not chosen and generally cannot fire.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While Texas is experimenting with “client choice,” in Washington state, a judge recently took a different tack to improve defendants’ legal representation. Drawing on past institutional reform cases involving school desegregation and prison overcrowding, U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Lasnik appointed a supervisor to oversee the public defense services in the cities of Mount Vernon and Burlington, Washington.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> In ordering this unprecedented remedy, Judge Lasnik found that the cities of Mount Vernon and Burlington had effectively instituted a constitutionally deficient “meet and plead” system in which lawyers handling 500 cases at a time would “often meet their clients for the first time in the courtroom, sometimes with a plea offer already in hand.” In this context, “discussions regarding possible defenses, the need for investigation, existing physical or mental health issues, immigration status, client goals, and potential dispositions were, if they occurred at all, perfunctory and/or public.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> “The system is broken to such an extent,” he concluded, “that confidential attorney-client communications are rare, the individual defendant is not represented in any meaningful way, and actual innocence could conceivably go unnoticed and unchampioned.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The top-down approach is doomed to fail. For everything Judge Lasnik can dream up to force criminal-defense lawyers to do for their indigent clients, there are a hundred other ways the lawyers can do poor jobs. It’s criminal-defense policy Whac-A-Mole.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">When considering reforms, some believe that State Supreme Courts also ought to do more to assist. Here, Florida supplies an interesting example. In the 1990s, the Florida Supreme Court confronted a case challenging the backlog of appeals by indigent defendants in which briefs were overdue. In evaluating how to address these delinquent filings, the court first pointed out the “woefully inadequate funding of the public defenders’ offices” and observed that the problem “affects both trial and appellate caseload.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> The court then noted that, although the legislature’s failure to adequately fund the public defenders’ offices was “at the heart of this problem, and the legislature should live up to its responsibilities and appropriate an adequate amount for this purpose, it is not the function of this Court to decide what constitutes adequate funding and then order the legislature to appropriate such an amount.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> But, the court did not stop there, choosing, instead, to send a clear message to the Florida legislature:</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">[A]lthough this court may not be able to order the legislature to appropriate those funds, we must advise the legislature that if sufficient funds are not appropriated within sixty days from the filing of this opinion, and counsel hired and appearances filed within 120 days from the filing of this opinion, the courts of this state with appropriate jurisdiction will entertain motions for writs of habeas corpus from those indigent appellants whose appellate briefs are delinquent sixty days or more, and upon finding merit to those petitions, will order the immediate release pending appeal of indigent convicted felons who are otherwise bondable.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">The court and the legislature were eyeball to eyeball, and then the legislature blinked.

True the legislature was in charge of state appropriations, but under the court’s inherent power, the court was in charge of the state’s </span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">That was the Florida Supreme Court’s special responsibility under the Florida Constitution. That’s how the separation of powers worked in Florida. And the Florida Supreme Court was not about to preside over and tolerate a systemically unconstitutional and unethical criminal justice system in that state. If the only thing the legislature could understand was the threat of the immediate release of thousands of indigent convicted felons onto the streets of the State of Florida, then so be it.</span>

Studies tend to show similar conviction rates. But, studies of convicted individuals also tend to find harsher consequences for those with publicly-financed counsel. One recent Bureau of Justice Statistics study found, for instance, that defendants with publicly-financed counsel were more likely to be sentenced to prison, while another recent study found that clients of public defenders received, on average, prison sentences that were three years longer than the sentences received by clients who were privately represented.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> But, these disparities do not necessarily reflect inferior public defense. They could, instead, reflect the fact that “marginally indigent” defendants choose to tap resources of family and friends to hire private counsel when they believe they have a good chance of avoiding conviction. Because of this selection bias, public defenders may end up with a disproportionate share of matters in which evidence of guilt is overwhelming.</span>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">While it is unclear whether public defenders offer better representation than private lawyers or vice versa, there is good evidence that court-appointed lawyers are less effective as compared to public defenders from independent systems. A 2012 study canvassing more than 3,000 Philadelphia murder cases found that clients fared better when they were represented by a lawyer from an independent public defender organization than if they had one appointed by a judge: Their conviction rate was 19 percent lower; the chance that they would serve a life sentence was reduced by 62 percent; and their expected sentence length was 24 percent shorter.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> requires supervising attorneys to monitor workloads and take appropriate action if workloads become excessive. It more controversially admonishes:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">If the problem of an excessive workload cannot be resolved through the nonacceptance of new clients or by other available measures, the lawyer should move to withdraw as counsel in existing cases to the extent necessary to bring the workload down to a manageable level, while at all times attempting to limit the prejudice to any client from whose case the lawyer has withdrawn.<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.937" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.937" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span></p>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">Does that seem like a sound solution? Suppose that you are a public defender with a bulging caseload. You suspect that, if you withdraw from representing a particular client, a lawyer who tends to provide even shoddier representation is apt to replace you. How should you proceed?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In keeping with that Formal Opinion’s advice, some attorneys have risked contempt charges rather than go to trial when overwhelming caseloads prevented adequate preparation. Does that civil disobedience seem justifiable? If you were an overloaded public defender asked to represent 300-plus clients simultaneously, what would you do?</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">I can confirm from my own experience as a judge that criminal defendants are generally poorly represented, but if we are to be hardheaded we must recognize that this may not be an entirely bad thing. The lawyers who represent indigent criminal defendants seem to be good enough to reduce the probability of convicting an innocent person to a very low level. If they were much better, either many guilty people would be acquitted or society would have to devote much greater resources to the prosecution of criminal cases. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page402" class="pagebreak" title="402">402</span>A bare-bones system for defense of indigent criminal defendants may be optimal.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.938" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.938" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As noted above, whether publicly or privately funded, some defense lawyers provide seriously shoddy assistance. Trial records, even in capital cases, reveal examples of counsel who functioned more as spectators than advocates—who failed to conduct any investigation, introduce any evidence, cross-examine any witnesses, or even remain awake and sober while in court.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, this Court has recognized that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists, and is needed, in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Because of the vital importance of counsel’s assistance, this Court has held that, with certain exceptions, a person accused of a federal or state crime has the right to have counsel appointed if retained counsel cannot be obtained. That a person who happens to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused, however, is not enough to satisfy the constitutional command. The Sixth Amendment recognizes the right to the assistance of counsel because it envisions counsel’s playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results. An accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney, whether retained or appointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">For that reason, the Court has recognized that “the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.” . . . The Court has not [previously] elaborated on the meaning of the constitutional requirement of effective assistance. . . . In giving </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">meaning to the requirement, however, we must take its purpose—to ensure a fair trial—as the guide. The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A convicted defendant’s claim that counsel’s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> thus created a route for defendants to obtain post-conviction relief because of counsel’s deficiency—but the route created was narrow and strewn with obstacles.

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Similarly, between 1984 and 2003, even while the Court continued to pay lip service to the potential availability of relief, courts declined to find inadequate representation even when the defendant’s lawyer was drunk, on drugs, or parking his car during key parts of the prosecution’s case. Meanwhile, certain unlucky defendants were executed despite their lawyers’ lack of any prior trial experience, ignorance of all relevant death penalty precedents, or failure to offer any witnesses, closing argument, or mitigating evidence.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, for example, the Court granted habeas</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> relief to a death row defendant whose attorneys failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of mitigating circumstances, when even the most cursory review would have revealed facts about the defendant’s experience of abuse that could well have affected the jury’s sentencing deliberations.

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the Court emphasized the limits of its ruling. The majority made clear that defense counsel would not always be required to present mitigating evidence or even to perform a full investigation.

        <span style="color: #000000;"> And, in a noteworthy pair of 2012 cases decided the same day, the Court held for the first time that the duty of effective assistance of counsel applies to plea bargains </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, where a defendant’s attorney simply refused to file a notice of appeal despite the defendant’s repeated requests. Lower courts had denied the habeas petition, reasoning that the defendant could not show that the appeal would have succeeded—and that, without such evidence, the prejudice prong of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> was not satisfied. Reversing, the Court ruled that “when counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal, with no need for a further showing.” </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> But nonetheless, the trend is to signal less tolerance for grossly defective lawyering—an improvement over pre-2003 decisions, that, for example, applied a three-step analysis to determine how much dozing by trial counsel is constitutionally permissible: “(1) did counsel sleep for repeated and/or prolonged lapses; (2) was counsel actually unconscious; and (3) were the defendant’s interests at stake while counsel was asleep?”</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is the relationship between <span style="font-style: italic;">Strickland</span> and the client’s ability to sue for deficient performance? In most states, a former criminal defendant who sues for legal malpractice must prove not only that he would have won his criminal case had his lawyer performed reasonably under the circumstances, but also that he is actually innocent. Furthermore, in many jurisdictions, if a court rejects a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on habeas review, the collateral estoppel doctrine bars a later malpractice determination. Thus, as two commentators put it: “<span style="font-style: italic;">Strickland</span> does double duty: It is both very deferential on appeal and also insulates many lawyers from malpractice liability.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.944" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.944" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">We now shift gears. The preceding discussion considered the costs of insufficiently zealous representation. The discussion below focuses on potential problems—including client perjury, document destruction, heavy-handed witness preparation, and overly aggressive impeachment on cross-examination—associated with representation that is arguably </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">too</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> zealous. Recognize, these are chronic and cross-cutting dilemmas of litigation. Thus, although our focus is on criminal proceedings, where the stakes are often highest and the issues are the most sharply drawn, many of these dilemmas also arise in civil litigation.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To begin, note that Rule 3.1, which generally protects the integrity of tribunals, specifically gives criminal defense lawyers extra latitude. It provides:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In other words, from the outset, the Rules recognize that a criminal defense lawyer is entitled to defend a client who she knows to be guilty—and make arguments she knows to be unsupported—in order to force the government to sustain its heavy burden of proof.</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although Rule 3.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.1&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> permits lawyers to seek the acquittal of even patently guilty clients, there are several limits on what defense attorneys </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page407" class="pagebreak" title="407">407</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">can do in pursuit of that objective. One limit involves the admission of false or perjured testimony.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Rule 3.3 supplies the relevant standard. Rule 3.3(a)(3)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.3(a)(3)&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> advises that a lawyer “shall not knowingly . . . offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.” Rule 3.3(a)(3) further admonishes: “A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false.” Then, under Rule 3.3(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.3(b)&quot; \s &quot;3.3(b)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">:</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A lawyer who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Finally, Rule 3.3(c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.3(c)&quot; \s &quot;3.3(c)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> clarifies:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 [the provision regulating client confidentiality].</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">No issue in legal ethics has attracted greater attention than the problem of perjury by criminal defendants. The issue is critical </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">not</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> because it arises frequently in practice. Indeed, many advocates insist that they rarely have actual knowledge that their client is lying, and those cases (like most criminal cases, generally) are apt to be resolved through plea bargains. Rather, the question is crucial because it establishes the boundaries of clients’ trust and lawyers’ competing obligations of truthfulness and confidentiality—and </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">those</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> issues, so central to the lawyers’ role, affect the attorney-client relationship in every case.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[Editors’ Note: The case involved a defendant convicted of the second-degree murder of Calvin Love. The crime took place in Iowa when Whiteside and two companions visited Love’s apartment seeking marijuana. An argument over the ownership of a certain amount of marijuana broke out, and, in the midst of the argument, Love directed his girlfriend to get his “piece.” According to Whiteside’s testimony, Love then started to reach under his pillow and move toward Whiteside, whereupon Whiteside stabbed Love in the chest, inflicting a fatal wound. </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page408" class="pagebreak" title="408">408</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">After Whiteside was charged with murder, he gave a statement to Gary Robinson, his court-appointed attorney. In that statement, Whiteside indicated that he had stabbed Love as the latter “was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow on the bed.” Upon questioning by Robinson, however, Whiteside indicated that he had not actually seen a gun, but that he was nevertheless convinced that Love had a gun. A police search revealed no weapon, and none of Whiteside’s companions reported seeing a gun. Robinson advised Whiteside that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish the claim of self-defense; Whiteside only had to show a reasonable belief that Love had a gun nearby.]</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Until shortly before trial, Whiteside consistently stated to Robinson that he had not actually seen a gun, but that he was convinced that Love had a gun in his hand. About a week before trial, during preparation for direct examination, Whiteside for the first time told Robinson and his associate Donna Paulsen that he had seen something “metallic” in Love’s hand. When asked about this, Whiteside responded: “[I]n Howard Cook’s case there was a gun. If I don’t say I saw a gun, I’m dead.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Robinson told Whiteside that such testimony would be perjury and repeated that it was not necessary to prove that a gun was available but only that Whiteside reasonably believed that he was in danger. On Whiteside’s insisting that he would testify that he saw “something metallic” Robinson told him, according to Robinson’s testimony:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[W]e could not allow him to [testify falsely] because that would be perjury, and as officers of the court we would be suborning perjury if we allowed him to do it; . . . I advised him that if he did do that it would be my duty to advise the Court of what he was doing and that I felt he was committing perjury; also, that I probably would be allowed to attempt to impeach that particular testimony.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Robinson also indicated he would seek to withdraw from the representation if Whiteside insisted on committing perjury.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.945" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.945" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Whiteside testified in his own defense at trial and stated that he “knew” that Love had a gun and that he believed Love was reaching for a gun and he had acted swiftly in self-defense. On cross-examination, he admitted that he had not actually seen a gun in Love’s hand. Robinson presented evidence that Love had been seen with a sawed-off shotgun on other occasions, that the police search of the apartment may have been careless, and that the victim’s family had removed everything from the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page409" class="pagebreak" title="409">409</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">apartment shortly after the crime. Robinson presented this evidence to show a basis for Whiteside’s asserted fear that Love had a gun.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder, and Whiteside moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of effective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed respondent’s conviction. That court held that the right to have counsel present all appropriate defenses does not extend to using perjury, and that an attorney’s duty to a client does not extend to assisting a client in committing perjury. . . . The court commended “both Mr. Robinson and Ms. Paulsen for the high ethical manner in which this matter was handled.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[Editors’ Note: Whiteside then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel. The district court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. In the appellate panel’s view, Robinson’s warning to Whiteside that he would inform the court of the perjury constituted a threat to violate the attorney’s obligation to preserve client confidences.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously disagreed. Justice Burger’s majority opinion noted that the right of an accused to testify on his own behalf is of relatively recent origin. Until the end of the nineteenth century, criminal defendants were disqualified as witnesses on grounds of bias; under current due process standards, the right to testify is generally assumed. However, in the Court’s view, that right does not extend to false testimony. </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Nix</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> was decided three years after the ABA adopted the Model Rules, at a time when many states still used rules based on the previous Model Code of Professional Responsibility. The Court therefore discusses both sets of standards. According to Justice Burger’s opinion:]</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Both the Model Code of Professional Responsibility and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct also adopt the specific exception from the attorney-client privilege for disclosure of perjury that his client intends to commit or has committed. DR 4–101(C)(3) (intention of client to commit a crime); Rule 3.3 (lawyer has duty to disclose falsity of evidence even if disclosure compromises client confidences). Indeed, both the Model Code and the Model Rules do not merely </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">authorize</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> disclosure by counsel of client perjury; they </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">These standards confirm that the legal profession has accepted that an attorney’s ethical duty to advance the interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct; it specifically ensures that the client may not use false evidence. This special duty of an attorney to prevent and disclose frauds upon the court derives from the recognition that perjury is as much a crime as tampering with witnesses or jurors by way of promises and threats, and undermines the administration of justice.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The commentary [to Model Rule 3.3] . . . also suggests that an attorney’s revelation of his client’s perjury to the court is a professionally responsible and acceptable response to the conduct of a client who has actually given perjured testimony. Similarly, the Model Rules and the commentary, as well as the Code of Professional Responsibility adopted in Iowa, expressly permit withdrawal from representation as an appropriate response of an attorney when the client threatens to commit perjury. Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(a)(1), Rule 1.6, Comment (1983); Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2–110(B), (C) (1980). Withdrawal of counsel when this situation arises at trial gives rise to many difficult questions including possible mistrial and claims of double jeopardy. . . . Whether Robinson’s conduct is seen as a successful attempt to dissuade his client from committing the crime of perjury, or whether seen as a “threat” to withdraw from representation and disclose the illegal scheme, Robinson’s representation of Whiteside falls well within accepted standards of professional conduct and the range of reasonable professional conduct acceptable under </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Court of Appeals’ holding that Robinson’s “action deprived Whiteside of due process and effective assistance of counsel” is not supported by the record since Robinson’s action, at most, deprived Whiteside of his contemplated perjury. Nothing counsel did in any way undermined Whiteside’s claim that he believed the victim was reaching for a gun. Similarly, the record gives no support for holding that Robinson’s action “also impermissibly compromised Whiteside’s right to testify in his own defense by conditioning continued representation . . . and confidentiality upon Whiteside’s </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">restricted</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> testimony.” The record in fact shows the contrary: (a) that Whiteside did testify, and (b) he was “restricted” or restrained only from testifying falsely and was aided by Robinson in developing the basis for the fear that Love was reaching for a gun. Robinson divulged no client communications until he was compelled to do so in response to Whiteside’s post-trial challenge to the quality of his performance. We see this as a case in which the attorney successfully dissuaded the client from committing the crime of perjury. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On this record, the accused enjoyed continued representation within the bounds of reasonable professional conduct and did in fact exercise his right to testify; at most he was denied the right to have the assistance of counsel in the presentation of false testimony. Similarly, we can discern no breach of professional duty in Robinson’s admonition to respondent that he would disclose respondent’s perjury to the court. The crime of perjury in this setting is indistinguishable in substance from the crime of threatening or tampering with a witness or a juror. A defendant who informed his counsel that he was arranging to bribe or threaten witnesses or members of the jury would have no “right” to insist on counsel’s assistance or silence. Counsel would not be limited to advising against that conduct. An attorney’s duty of confidentiality, which totally </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page411" class="pagebreak" title="411">411</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">covers the client’s admission of guilt, does not extend to a client’s announced plans to engage in future criminal conduct. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In short, the responsibility of an ethical lawyer, as an officer of the court and a key component of a system of justice, dedicated to a search for truth, is essentially the same whether the client announces an intention to bribe or threaten witnesses or jurors or to commit or procure perjury. No system of justice worthy of the name can tolerate a lesser standard.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Justice Brennan concurred separately, emphasizing that the Court has no constitutional or statutory authority to establish rules of ethics for lawyers practicing in state courts. In his words:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[T]he Court . . . <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> tell the States or the lawyers in the States how to behave in their courts, unless and until federal rights are violated.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Unfortunately, the Court seems unable to resist the temptation of sharing with the legal community its vision of ethical conduct. But let there be no mistake: the Court’s essay regarding what constitutes the correct response to a criminal client’s suggestion that he will perjure himself is pure discourse without force of law. As Justice Blackmun observes, <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> issue is a thorny one . . . but it is not an issue presented by this case. Lawyers, judges, bar associations, students, and others should understand that the problem has not now been “decided.”</p>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Justice Blackmun also penned a concurrence joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens that emphasized that the only issue before the Court was whether Whiteside’s Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial had been violated. In their view, it had not. The only effect that Robinson’s threat had on the trial was that Whiteside did not testify falsely. And, “[t]o the extent that Whiteside’s claim rests on the assertion that he would have been acquitted had he been able to testify falsely, he claims a right that the law does not recognize.” <a id="dabmci_358e9cf3e6b74da4a12d89e68528723c" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 186. The Justices also reasoned:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[T]he lawyer’s interest in not presenting perjured testimony was entirely consistent with Whiteside’s best interest. If Whiteside had lied on the stand, he would have risked a future perjury prosecution. Moreover, his testimony would have been contradicted by the testimony of other eyewitnesses and by the fact that no gun was ever found. In light of that impeachment, the jury might have concluded that Whiteside lied as well about his lack of premeditation and thus might have convicted him of first-degree murder. And if the judge believed that Whiteside had lied, he could have taken Whiteside’s perjury into account <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page412" class="pagebreak" title="412">412</span>in setting the sentence. [ ] In the face of these dangers, an attorney could reasonably conclude that dissuading his client from committing perjury was in the client’s best interest and comported with standards of professional responsibility.</p>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Nix v. Whiteside</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> raises two key questions. First: What standard of knowledge is required before the lawyer concludes that a defendant’s testimony is (or would be) false? Second: What should the defendant’s lawyer and/or the court do if the defendant insists on exercising his constitutional right to testify? Both questions deserve closer scrutiny. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The first question is: Before taking action, as required by Rule 3.3(b), how certain should counsel be that proposed testimony is or would be false? That issue is critical, since many trial attorneys insist that they virtually never “</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">know</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">” that their client intends to lie. And, this insistence makes sense, as defendants who plan to commit perjury generally have no reason to disclose their intention, and, for reasons noted above, defense lawyers, typically facing severe time and resource constraints, have little opportunity or incentive to investigate the veracity of a client’s story.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">So: How certain should counsel be that proposed testimony is false before denying defendants the right to make such statements? The short answer is: There’s substantial uncertainty and disagreement. </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Nix v. Whiteside</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">issued Formal Opinion 87–353<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Formal Opinion 87–353&quot; \s &quot;Formal Opinion 87–353&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> (1987)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, which advised lawyers to disclose to the court testimony that they “know” is false, but the Opinion failed to</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> define “know.” Meanwhile, under the Rules’ somewhat circular standard, “knowingly” means “actual knowledge of the fact in question,” which “may be inferred from circumstances.” Rule 1.0(f)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.0(f)&quot; \s &quot;1.0(f)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. This definition is helpful in that it rules out the criminal law’s “willful blindness” standard, which makes intentionally avoiding knowledge legally equivalent to knowledge. In so doing, the definition protects lawyers from disciplinary charges in cases where they refrained from asking their clients questions out of a fear that asking the question would reveal that the clients’ subsequent testimony was perjurious.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Seeking to clear up the uncertainty, in 2002, the ABA House of Delegates added the following clarifying language to Comment 8, accompanying Rule 3.3<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.3&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">:</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page413" class="pagebreak" title="413">413</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[8]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The prohibition against offering false evidence only applies if the lawyer knows that the evidence is false. A lawyer’s reasonable belief that evidence is false does not preclude its presentation to the trier of fact. A lawyer’s knowledge that the evidence is false, however, can be inferred from the circumstances. </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">See</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Rule 1.0(f). Thus, although a lawyer should resolve doubts about the veracity of testimony or other evidence in favor of the client, the lawyer cannot ignore an obvious falsehood.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Does that supply adequate guidance?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A related question involves the procedure that should be used if a client insists on giving testimony that the lawyer expects will be false, or if a client offers such testimony while on the witness stand. Recall, under Rule 3.3(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.3(b)&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, a lawyer who knows that a client intends to commit perjury or has committed perjury, “shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What constitutes a “reasonable remedial measure?” In most other settings, the prescribed response to client misconduct is withdrawal pursuant to Rule 1.16<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.16&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. However, courts and commentators have generally agreed that withdrawal is an unsatisfactory way to cope with the perjury dilemma in criminal cases, because it simply transfers the problem to the next attorney and gives a defendant the opportunity to trigger mistrials (potentially ad infinitum) by insisting on the right to testify.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But while withdrawal is disfavored, what constitutes the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">best</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> course of action is subject to dispute. Some suggest that defense counsel ought to notify the court. But, that tack, of course, breaches client confidentiality, and if the court is notified, numerous questions remain, including whether the court must conduct an independent inquiry or make findings on whether the proposed testimony has constituted, or would constitute, perjury. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Others suggest that the defendant should be allowed to testify in narrative form—that is, without the attorney asking questions. Under this approach, the lawyer would identify the witness as the defendant and invite him to tell his story to the jury, rather than examining the defendant in the normal question-and-answer way. Many believe the narrative approach is the best accommodation of competing principles; it avoids implicating lawyers in perjury while also giving clients, whose life or liberty are at stake, an opportunity to plead their cases. Some, though, see it differently, insisting that the approach “compromises both contending principles; it exempts the lawyer from the duty to disclose false evidence, but subjects the client to an implicit disclosure of information imparted to counsel.”</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">An alternative approach is to prioritize client confidentiality. Under this approach, lawyers should attempt to dissuade their clients from lying and should conduct the direct examination in a way that minimizes the risk of perjury. However, if they are unable to prevent perjury, they should not disclose it either directly to the court or implicitly to the jury through an unguided narrative.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The late Professor Monroe Freedman was a leading advocate of this position, as he thought it offered the best way out of what he called the “perjury trilemma”—a trio of jointly inconsistent obligations. Freedman argued that, in order to fulfill the first obligation of zealous advocacy, the attorney must learn all the significant facts of the client’s case. At the same time, the attorney labors under a second obligation of confidentiality, as well as a third obligation of candor to the court. Freedman argued that attorneys whose clients commit, or plan to commit, perjury can fulfill at most two of these three obligations. If they have learned all the significant facts, they will know that the testimony is perjurious, and then must either violate confidentiality or be less than candid to the court. Thus, they can reconcile the duties of confidentiality and candor only if they do not know that their clients’ testimony is false, but this implies that they have neglected their duties of zealous advocacy by failing to learn significant facts. Faced with these stubbornly inconsistent obligations, Freedman argued that candor to the court is the principle that ought to give. In his view, the duties of confidentiality and zealous advocacy are of paramount constitutional and moral significance; they are essential to effective assistance of counsel, which is “one of the most significant manifestations of our regard for the dignity of the individual” and a critical protection against governmental abuse.</span>

Alternatively, suppose Whiteside had said to Robinson, “I’m going to tell the court that I saw something metallic, and you’re not going to stop me.” Under Rule 3.3, could Robinson inform the court of this conversation before Robinson testified? </span>

Then your client “remembers” that he was at a party, which the alleged host does not recall throwing. Finally, your client recalls that he was at the movies with his sister.

        <span style="color: #000000;">all sorts of stratagems to minimize the effect on the judge or jury of testimony disadvantageous to his client, even when the lawyer has no doubt of the accuracy and honesty of that testimony. The lawyer considers it his duty to create a false impression, if he can, of any witness who gives such testimony. If such a witness happens to be timid, frightened by the unfamiliarity of courtroom ways, the lawyer, in his cross-examination, plays on that weakness, in order to confuse the witness and make it appear that he is concealing significant facts.</span>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Are clients entitled to a defense that includes impeaching a witness who is telling the truth? Does it matter if one purpose of the impeachment is to induce the witness to drop his or her charges?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many believe that impeachment of a truthful witness is especially problematic when the witness is the complainant in a rape case. Zealous advocacy in that context may carry special costs, in part, because of the particularly acute potential for humiliation, the fact that harsh or dismissive treatment may deter other victims from coming forward, and the societal impact of sanctioning rape myths—of fostering the false impression that women who claim rape are lying or, alternatively, that they provoked, permitted, or deserved what they got. Compounding these sensitivities, rape victims often suffer from rape trauma syndrome, which may lead them to suppress details of an assault. Zealous cross-examination can exploit confusion that may discredit a complainant’s basically accurate account.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.951" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.951" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Concerned about the above dynamics, Professor David Luban draws the following conclusion:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Matters would be different if rape were rare and false accusations of rape occurred regularly. Then the advocate’s role would properly focus on the vulnerability of [accused] men, not of women. Suffice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page417" class="pagebreak" title="417">417</span>it to say that the world is not this way . . . . In my view, then, the advocate’s role should stop well short of an all-out assault on the [truthful] prosecutrix. . . . The lawyer can ask the victim whether she consented. The lawyer can also argue reasonable doubt to the jury. What she cannot do is cross-examine her to make her look like a whore.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.952" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.952" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Others disagree. In the view of defense lawyer (and Professor) Kathleen Ridolphi:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">I have never felt conflicted about what side I stand on in a criminal trial. My political sensibilities keep me firmly planted on the side of the defendant. . . . [Sexual assault cases] frequently require that I, a feminist who rejects harmful stereotypes of women, exploit those same stereotypes in defense of my client. In the majority of sexual assault cases, the complainant and defendant know one another and fabrication or consent is raised as a defense. . . . As a consequence, in most sex cases, my role is to charge the complainant with having agreed to the sexual encounter, or having asked for it, or of being a woman scorned whose feeling of rejection caused her to cry rape as an act of revenge.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Some defense attorneys believe that effective cross-examination can be done in a way that does not demean the complainant. I disagree. No matter what tone of voice is used or how politely the questions are put, a good cross-examination must still ultimately demonstrate that the complaining witness is a liar.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Moreover, if the defense attorney is respectful of the complainant’s feelings, she lends credibility to the prosecution’s case. The more successful the defense counsel is at cutting away at the complainant’s credibility, the more effective the defense and necessarily, more damaged the complainant is. An attorney who is concerned about a complainant’s feelings necessarily compromises her client’s right to an advocate with exclusive loyalty.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.953" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.953" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Who has the better argument, Luban or Ridolphi? Should criminal defense lawyers <span style="font-style: italic;">ever</span> soft-peddle their advocacy? Sexual assault cases are not the only context in which complainants are vulnerable and particularly reluctant to report criminal conduct. If you accept Luban’s argument, does it call for special care in other contexts too? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />ABA Standards state: “Defense counsel should conduct the examination of witnesses fairly and with due regard for dignity and legitimate privacy concerns, and without seeking to intimidate or humiliate a witness </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page418" class="pagebreak" title="418">418</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">unnecessarily.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.954" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.954" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Does that mean that if it’s “necessary” to humiliate the witness, that humiliation is permissible? </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />ABA Standards also provide that “defense counsel’s belief or knowledge that the witness is telling the truth does not preclude vigorous cross-examination, even though defense counsel’s cross-examination may cast doubt on the testimony.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.955" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.955" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> An earlier edition of that Standard included the qualification that the lawyer’s belief “should, if possible, be taken into consideration by counsel in conducting the cross-examination.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.956" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.956" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span> What follows from this omission?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Professor William Simon advances a vision of ethical lawyering involving a “discretionary approach,” through which lawyers should seek to “do justice” by adjusting their actions on behalf of a client to accord with their evaluation of both the “internal merit” of the client’s case and its “relative merit” in relation to the interests of other affected parties. Toward this end, Simon suggests, a lawyer should consider, among other things, whether a particular litigation tactic is likely to promote the factfinder’s ability to decide the case fairly and the purposes of law, at least to the extent those purposes accord with fundamental values.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.957" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.957" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Is such a “do justice” approach sensible in the criminal justice context? Is there consensus within society generally, or the criminal defense bar in particular, about what “justice” requires in particular cases? What are the risks and benefits of Simon’s approach?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A public opinion survey presented a hypothetical in which defense counsel believed that an opposing witness’s testimony was accurate and truthful but that skillful cross-examination could discredit the witness’s memory or motives. Three-quarters of surveyed lawyers, but fewer than half of nonlawyers, believed that an attack on the witness’s memory was appropriate. Two-thirds of lawyers, but only 40 percent of nonlawyers, believed that an attack on motives was proper.</span>

        </span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Another controversial issue involves defense lawyers’ treatment of incriminating or potentially incriminating evidence. The treatment of such evidence implicates a range of sometimes competing interests: the lawyer’s duty of loyalty and fidelity; the lawyer’s duty of confidentiality (as discussed in Chapter 6); the client’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights; the lawyer’s own personal desire to avoid criminal prosecution </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page419" class="pagebreak" title="419">419</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">and professional discipline; and the state’s legitimate interest in promoting public safety and enforcing its laws.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Seeking to reconcile these rival interests, Rule 3.4(a) supplies the relevant authority. It provides that a lawyer shall not “unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value,” nor shall a lawyer “counsel or assist another person to do any such act.” </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Note that Rule 3.4(a) does not prohibit all concealment or destruction of evidence—only concealment or destruction that’s “unlawful.” Thus, much turns on whether concealment or destruction is or is not criminally proscribed. Importantly here, </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Model Penal Code § 241.7</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> and its state analogues criminalize destruction or concealment if the actor believes that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted. Likewise, the federal obstruction of justice statute prohibits any person from altering, concealing, or destroying evidence, with “the intent to impair [its] integrity and availability for use in an official proceeding.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> a friend of the defendant cleaned out his car at his attorney’s request. On discovering a kidnap plan, he turned it over to the attorney. The attorney consulted the Alaska bar ethics committee, which advised the attorney to return the plan to the friend, advise the friend on laws governing concealment of evidence, and withdraw from the case if it became obvious that an ethical violation would result. The attorney then withdrew and attempted to return the evidence. When the friend proved reluctant to accept it, the attorney helped arrange its transfer to the police. The defendant was convicted and appealed on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. In rejecting that claim, the court reasoned that the attorney would have been obligated to see that the evidence reached the prosecutor even if he had received it from the defendant, and that his obligation was even stronger because he had acquired it from a third party.</span>

The lawyer retrieved it, turned it over to the prosecution, and subsequently withdrew as defense counsel.

Accordingly, the court required the lawyer to testify about where he had found the wallet but not to disclose his former representation of the defendant or his reasons for searching the trash can. The court also suggested that, in the future, attorneys ought to consider leaving evidence in its original location.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, 334 F.3d 294 (3rd Cir. 2003)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. There, a gun show promoter and her husband were convicted of failing to file federal income tax returns for 1991 and 1992. The couple’s defense at trial was that they had filed their returns, but that the Internal Revenue Service had either lost or misplaced them. Just prior to the start of their trial, the couple gave their lawyer a box of what they claimed were newly discovered financial records, including what appeared to be copies of their 1991 and 1992 tax returns. Midway through the trial, the lawyer turned the documents over to prosecutors, who waited until their closing argument to show the jury that the purported returns for tax years 1991 and 1992 were dated for those respective years. This was problematic because taxes for those years would not be due until the following April 15th and appropriately-filed returns would be dated April 1992 and 1993, respectively—not 1991 and 1992. The Lamplughs were both convicted.</span>

The trial judge agreed and granted a new trial. The Third Circuit reversed, however, reasoning that the defendant should not be allowed to “manipulate the justice system by knowingly presenting fabricated written documents.” </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Document Retention and Destruction</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A related ethical quandary, particularly for white-collar criminal defense attorneys, involves the retention—or potential elimination—of incriminating documents or digital information. There is no question that, if it is uncovered, the consequences of document destruction can be devastating. As above, Rule 3.4(a) subjects counsel who “unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value” or who “counsel or assist another person to do any such act” to disciplinary sanctions. And, state and federal obstruction of justice statutes—which apply to documents just as surely as they apply to personal property—potentially subject individuals who conceal or destroy documents to harsh criminal penalties.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet document destruction still happens. One common problem is that lawyers who suspect but do not “know” that their client has engaged in illegal destruction may not reveal that fact.

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">knowing</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Two possible goals related to information control motivate the attorney in his meetings with clients. The first goal is to obtain adequate information about the situation being investigated. . . . The second goal, which can exist only in conjunction with the first, is to keep the client from communicating too much information to the attorney, information that would interfere with his building a strong defense. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Defense attorneys know that they walk a narrow line between helping and hurting their case when they facilitate or allow a client to hide facts from the attorney himself. Not having knowledge of an inculpatory fact that the government discovers can completely destroy a defense attorney’s argument, which is why some attorneys reject this approach. But of the attorneys I studied, most either said that they sometimes preferred not to get certain facts from a client or showed by their actions that they felt this way. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Here is an archetype scenario of the attorney in the inquiry avoidance role: a subpoena is issued by a court calling for the client to produce all documents related to a certain transaction. Upon receipt, the client takes the subpoena to an attorney and asks, “How do I proceed?” In the characteristic case of avoidance, the attorney begins by explaining to the client what is called for by the subpoena and what significance certain types of documents would have for the course of the investigation. He will not blandly ask the client what documents currently exist but will explain to the client what the subpoena indicates about the subject and scope of the investigation. Some attorneys go one step further and explain to the client what kinds of documents could be used against the client “</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">if</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> they exist.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">An attorney who is avoiding inquiry will not ask, “Did such documents ever exist?” or “Was document X or document Y found?” His interaction with the client is likely to be limited to a narrower question: “Do you have anything to present in response to the subpoena?” . . . </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Facilitation of Concealment</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . A large number of respondents indicated that some clients make open proposals to destroy or manipulate evidence. [When interviewed, one] attorney stated the following:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">When you have a client who’s in a very bad bind and he’s going to have to essentially convict himself by turning over bank records, or accountant records, or what have you, the client has a very strong impulse to do something about it, to save his own neck. From the client’s point of view, there is not much to lose at that stage—he knows he’s stuck if he doesn’t do something. Occasionally, a client will say something like, “If I get rid of the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page424" class="pagebreak" title="424">424</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">records now, isn’t it true that no one will know the difference?” . . . I don’t say, “Look, I can’t allow you to do that.” That puts me in a one-up moral position and is most embarrassing for the client. I usually say something like, “The penalties are very severe, and it is true that it may turn up later and cause you more trouble, so I advise you not to do it.” That makes it seem more like I’m helping him protect himself rather than demonstrating some kind of moral superiority. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Justifications</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . [M]any attorneys would not see effective—as opposed to intentional—facilitation of evidence destruction as a malfunction in the system of adversarial representation, even if it were in fact partially the consequence of the way attorneys handled their clients. Rather, it would be seen as the inevitable by-product of an adversarial system whose higher value requires that the attorney be able to maximize his zeal for his client’s cause while minimizing, if not eliminating altogether, any law </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">enforcement</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> role on his part. Attorneys believed this strongly and were prepared to defend it vigorously. As one stated,</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It’s my mission and obligation to defend the client, not to sit in moral, ethical, or legal judgment of him. I cannot join him in transgressing the law, but whatever he does of his own impetus, whatever way he conducts himself in attempting to protect himself, is a decision he has to make independent of what I do. I must inform him of the consequences and significance of his action but not punish him or sanction him or in other ways initiate law enforcement actions against him. My role in the adversary system is to protect him.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . The underlying notion of an adversary system helps the attorney to cope with uneasiness he may have about specific actions he takes. The adversary system as a whole is assumed to serve the greater social good, even if some of its details do not appear so. Thus, if a rule mandates or permits a specific behavior—such as an attorney’s answering questions posed by the clients as hypotheticals—that behavior is legitimate because it is part of a system that works. It is a deductive logic: if the system works, then the specific rules are right.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Chapter 6 indicates, the standard justification for the attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality stresses advocates’ obligation to learn all the details of their clients’ cases. To fulfill this obligation, attorneys must be able to reassure their clients that everything they reveal will remain confidential. But most of the lawyers that Mann interviewed do not want to learn all the details of their clients’ cases. Is their “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy consistent with the justification for sweeping confidentiality protections?</span>

      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page425" class="pagebreak" title="425">425</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider Mann’s final observation concerning the worldview of white-collar defense lawyers. They justify a selective ignorance that undermines the effectiveness of the adversary system by arguing that such practices are “part of a system that works. It is a deductive logic: if the system works, then the specific rules are right.” But do those practices make the system work less well?</span>

(A litigation hold is an internal notice disseminated within a company advising employees that a lawsuit has been filed or is reasonably anticipated; it directs employees to identify, locate, and preserve records pertaining to the subject matter described therein.) The lawyer instructed the engineers to “check their documents,” which the engineers interpreted to mean that they should purge their defeat-device-related records and e-mails prior to the hold being issued. Some forty engineers and other employees subsequently destroyed thousands of documents, though many were later recovered by investigators.

Russell</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">, 639 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D. Conn. 2007)</span>. There, Philip Russell faced charges for obstruction of justice in connection <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page426" class="pagebreak" title="426">426</span>with the investigation of the church’s music director, Robert Tate. According to the indictment, a church employee using Tate’s computer for church-related business discovered images of naked boys. Church officials seized the computer, hired attorney Russell, and promptly confronted Tate with the images, whereupon Take acknowledged responsibility, resigned from the church, and was given the name of a local criminal defense attorney. The following day, Russell dismantled and destroyed the computer. However, unknown to attorney Russell, the FBI had independently launched an investigation into Tate’s use of child pornography.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The government charged Russell with two counts of obstruction of justice. It alleged a violation of </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, on the ground that Russell had “corruptly altered, destroyed, mutilated and concealed” an object with “the intent to impair [its] integrity and availability for use in an official proceeding.” In addition, the government alleged that Russell had violated </span>
        <a id="dabmci_54161dacd89b4eb986bf9114bab8b118" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">18 U.S.C. § 1519</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, which, as noted above, prohibits the knowing destruction of any object “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation of . . . any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.” Both counts are punishable by up to twenty years in prison.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Russell moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the government could not show that he had intended to obstruct an identifiable investigation because he was unaware that one was in process. The district court rejected that argument. In its view, the fact that the church had treated the computer as evidence and had recommended that Tate retain a criminal defense attorney was enough to suggest that an investigation was reasonably foreseeable. Russell then pled guilty to misprision (concealment) of a felony, based on his failure to report the commission of the child pornography crime. He was sentenced to six months of home confinement and a $25,000 fine.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Critics of the decision questioned how the government would be able to prove that the investigation was reasonably foreseeable beyond a reasonable doubt.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Joseph Goulden describes one of his interviews with a Washington criminal defense lawyer over a candid three-martini lunch. Partway through the interview, the lawyer pointed across the room to a former client. Several years ago, he had represented the client in an FTC investigation. The client had been doing some “odd-ball accounting” to the detriment of certain customers. One of them had complained to the FTC. In the lawyer’s view, the practice constituted a “clear cut violation” of the Robinson-Patman Act. “Trouble was coming,” </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Now, in a situation like this, the documents should tell the whole story and I don’t see any reason why a man should help the federal government build a gallows for himself.

Oh, they could, but only by backtracking to customers. But I know the FTC is so short-handed they won’t do that except in a major case. “Do you still have any documents around that could hurt you?” I asked him. “Some of this stuff must be getting pretty old, and most people turn over their records fairly fast.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are a state bar counsel and you are considering whether to file disciplinary charges against Nancy Temple. Temple served as an in-house lawyer for the Arthur Andersen accounting firm prior to its dissolution in connection with the Enron scandal. The conduct at issue involves Temple’s instructions to Andersen staff concerning documents related both to the audit of questionable investment vehicles for Enron, and to the certification of the company’s potentially misleading financial statements. Like many companies, Andersen had a detailed document retention policy calling for the destruction of all nonessential draft documents or conflicting documentation relating to an audit.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.972" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.972" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The policy itself is not unusual. Your concerns arise from the timing and context of a memo that Temple sent on October 12, 2002, calling for compliance with that policy.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Specifically, Temple’s October 12 e-mail to Andersen’s Houston practice director stated: “It might be useful to consider reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure that we have complied with that policy.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.973" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.973" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Then, on October 23, the lead engagement partner on the Enron audit ordered </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page428" class="pagebreak" title="428">428</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">his team to comply with Andersen’s policy. The result was an extraordinary volume of document destruction over the next several weeks. Media reports chronicled the shredding of more than eighteen trunks and thirty boxes of material on only one of the days at one of the offices, compared with an average of one trunk per week in the preceding period.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Not until November 10, after the SEC had subpoenaed documents from Andersen concerning its Enron investigation and after Andersen had received a second subpoena in a related lawsuit, did Temple instruct the Enron engagement team “to preserve documents, computer files and other information relating to Enron.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.975" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.975" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Temple’s conduct was the subject of a 2002 congressional hearing in which she characterized her actions as customary housekeeping duties. In that hearing, she admitted awareness, prior to October 8, of allegations by an Enron employee of inappropriate accounting procedures, as well as an investigation of those allegations by outside counsel. The SEC placed Enron under investigation in early October, and it confirmed that fact publicly in an October 22 press release. Temple’s notes from a conference call on October 8 anticipated that outcome: “Highly probable some SEC investigation.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.976" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.976" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Temple also knew that outside counsel had been retained on October 9 to assist Andersen with legal difficulties arising out of its financial reporting for Enron.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In subsequent criminal proceedings against Andersen for obstructing the SEC investigation, prosecutors argued that Temple’s “reminder” about the audit firm’s document shredding policies encouraged destruction of materials relevant to that investigation. Andersen was convicted under </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, which makes it a crime to “knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]” another person to withhold documents. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that conviction because the jury instructions did not require findings of the required degree of knowledge.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The U.S.’s level of imprisonment is five to ten times higher than that of other liberal democracies. We imprison individuals at nine times the rate of Germany and seven times the rate of France.</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Racial disparities in the criminal justice system cannot be explained solely by higher rates of criminal activity among impoverished people of color. At every stage of the process, similarly situated individuals are treated differently on the basis of race and ethnicity.

Controlling for relevant factors, blacks and Hispanics are also substantially more likely than whites to be detained before trial, denied bail, given higher bail, or denied options such as release on their own recognizance. . . . In most studies that compare similarly situated offenders of different races, whites are more likely to have charges reduced and less likely to be incarcerated or to receive extended sentences than blacks and Hispanics. Blacks are also more likely to receive a death sentence even when controlling for the severity of the crime and the characteristics of the victim.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.991" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.991" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span></p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">You are the prosecutor in a robbery case with strong evidence of guilt. The victim had an excellent opportunity to observe the robber and readily identified him at a lineup shortly after the incident. But the defense also has an eyewitness to the assault—and the defendant’s eyewitness claims that the assailant was not the defendant.

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Two areas of greatest prosecutorial power involve the choice of targets to investigate and the selection of offenses to charge. In most countries, the state is expected to file indictments for every felony supported by sufficient evidence. By contrast, American prosecutors have remarkable leeway to select whether to bring charges and, if they decide in the affirmative, which charges to bring. These decisions are vested in prosecutors alone, and, as the Supreme Court has observed, almost entirely immune from judicial review. </span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[This unfettered discretion] make[s] prosecutors the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system. While the police determine who “enters” the criminal justice process, prosecutors have complete control over which cases they file and which ones they dismiss. If prosecutors decide to move a case forward, their choice of what charges to bring is limited solely by what they think they can prove—or what they think they can convince defendants they can prove [given ubiquitous plea bargains]. These charges in turn often place significant limitations on the sentences that judges can impose. Prosecutors are free to threaten whatever severe sanctions legislators have passed, and legislators have been happy to enact tougher and tougher laws. It’s true that judges are required to sign off on pleas and can thus reject those they find unsatisfactory, but in general, they will acquiesce to the deals struck by the prosecutors and defense attorneys.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.994" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.994" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span></p>

      </p>
      <p class="FileLine">
        <span style="color: #000000;">71 University of Michigan Law Review 1145, 1156–1159 (1973).</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The interesting part [of the ABA standard permitting prosecutors to decline to prosecute a case when she herself entertains a reasonable doubt about guilt] is the suggestion that if the prosecutor, imagining himself in the seat of a juror, would not vote for a verdict of guilty, he may decline to present the matter to the system’s designated fact finder. I have heard prosecutors, as a matter of personal conscience, take this notion as an ethical imperative. “I never try a defendant,” so runs the credo, “unless I am personally convinced of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Or, for some: “beyond any doubt.” Realistically, the prosecutor figures that, inflamed by the brutal facts of the crime or for some other reason, the jury may overlook the basis for the doubt which nags his own judgment. And he could not sleep at night having contributed to the conviction of a man who might just possibly be innocent. Of course, in reaching this extra-judicial judgment, the prosecutor will allow himself to consider relevant items which might be excluded from trial evidence. Nor would his refusal to prosecute the case necessarily mean he would decline to recommend the acceptance of a guilty plea, for the confession which normally accompanies the plea may remove the prosecutor’s doubt.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet withal, the prosecutor’s conscientious stand represents a notable modification of our system of determining truth and adjudicating guilt. At the least it creates a new subtrial, informal and often ex parte, interposed between the determinations of the accusing and judging authorities. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A concrete, commonplace example may illustrate the operation of the precept and flesh out our appraisal of its wisdom. Practitioners know too well a sticky item: the one-eye-witness-identification case. For instance, an elderly white person is suddenly grabbed from behind in a dimly lit vestibule by a black youth who shows a knife and takes the victim’s wallet. The entire incident occupies thirty seconds. Some days later, the victim spots the defendant in the neighborhood and has him arrested by the nearest policeman. Although the prosecutor presses him hard, the victim swears he has picked the right man. There is nothing unusual about the defendant’s appearance, the victim never saw him before the crime, and he admits he does not know many blacks personally, but his certainty cannot be shaken. He insists that in those few moments of terror his attacker’s face was “indelibly engraved on his memory.” The defendant may have an alibi: his mother will testify that at the time of the crime he was at home watching television with her (not evidence readily credited). And that is the entire case.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Thus, when the issue stands in equipoise in his own mind, when he is honestly unable to judge where the truth of the matter lies, I see no </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page435" class="pagebreak" title="435">435</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">flaw in the conduct of the prosecutor who fairly lays the matter before the judge or jury. . . . Although the prosecutor’s discretionary powers may be important, and his detached and honorable presence vital, he is not, after all, the sole repository of justice. Thus, I do not believe that the system is served by canons which overplay the prosecutor’s “quasi-judicial” role. He is, let us remember, an advocate as well as a minister of public justice.</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">To sweeten plea deals, prosecutors offer plea discounts by dismissing or reducing the seriousness of some of the charges (which are called charge bargains), offering a suggested lower amount of punishment (sentence bargains), or both. The flip side of the plea discount is the trial penalty: Defendants who refuse to take plea deals face additional and more serious charges, and prosecutors push for more punishment if defendants are found guilty. Judges are key players in the system, because defendants and defense lawyers must believe that judges will impose lower penalties if defendants plead guilty but heavier punishments if they refuse to plead and are convicted at trial. Empirical evidence confirms that judges impose a trial penalty, which creates an increasingly wide spread between plea offers and threatened post-trial sentences.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.995" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.995" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span></p>

Notice that bar ethical rules and the ABA Standards require, at a minimum, probable cause—and this probable cause standard is less than exacting. According to Professor Bruce Green, the standard can be satisfied even if the prosecutor is unconvinced that it is “ ‘more likely than not’ that the accused is guilty. All that is needed is a fair possibility of guilt, something more than ‘reasonable suspicion.’ ”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> that a prosecutor has impermissibly allowed race to infect his or her judgment face a tough—and nearly impossible—road.

        <span style="color: #000000;">. There, the government brought charges against two defendants, John David Stumpf and Clyde David Wesley, for armed robbery and murder. Stumpf pleaded guilty to aggravated murder, even though the guilty plea left him eligible for the death penalty. Subsequently, in a contested penalty hearing before a three-judge panel, he claimed in mitigation that he had acted at Wesley’s urging and that Wesley had killed the victim. The state argued that Stumpf had fired the fatal shot. Siding with the state, the panel found that Stumpf “was the principal offender,” and sentenced him to death. Then, at Wesley’s subsequent jury trial, the state presented evidence that </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Wesley</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">admitted</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Stumpf then moved to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his death sentence on the basis of the prosecutor’s reliance on inconsistent theories to convict both defendants of the same offense. The Sixth Circuit found for Stumpf, but a unanimous Supreme Court reversed in part and remanded. In the Court’s view, which defendant pulled the trigger was immaterial to Stumpf’s conviction because state law made aiders and abettors liable for murder. However, because Stumpf’s role may have been material to the death sentence, on that point, the Court remanded for further findings. Ultimately, the Sixth Circuit affirmed Stumpf’s death penalty conviction. </span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Prosecutors have offered contradictory theories about which defendant stabbed someone with a knife, or chopped a woman’s skull with a hatchet, or held a man’s head underwater. The most common scenario involves a fatal shot: the prosecutor puts the gun in the hand of one defendant, then another. Under the legal principle of accomplice liability, a defendant can be convicted of murder without being the killer. But, if the prosecutor says that a defendant pulled the trigger, it’s easier to ask a judge or a jury for a death sentence. At least twenty-nine men have been condemned in cases in which defense attorneys accused prosecutors of presenting contradictory theories. To date, seven of those twenty-nine have been executed.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1005" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1005" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">137</a></span></p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Another reason certain cases aren’t prosecuted is that the complaining witness recants or refuses to cooperate. However, some prosecutors’ offices operate with “no drop” policies for domestic violence cases. Under these policies, the government proceeds, even when a survivor requests that her complaint be dismissed. Prosecutors who support such policies reason that, otherwise, victims will be pressured by perpetrators to withhold cooperation. Victims, for their part, often legitimately fear retaliation if the case proceeds, whether or not they willingly testify. Failure to respect victims’ wishes may also discourage them from contacting law enforcement in the first instance. How would you assess the merits of such a policy, which often trade additional risks to one victim in order to achieve greater deterrence and to protect other victims from pressure to withdraw their complaints?</span>

She claims that she was raped by several white members of a university lacrosse team who had asked her to perform as a stripper. Several of the university’s athletic teams have a record of alcohol-related offenses, and town-gown relations have been complicated by class and racial divisions and tensions.</span>

The woman has a history of drug, alcohol, and mental health difficulties, and she gives inconsistent accounts of the number of assailants. Further, she is unable to identify assailants from two lineups. And, though she does eventually positively identify three players from a photo lineup, that photo lineup did not conform to accepted practice—and one of the identified players has photographic and telephone records that place him elsewhere.

(Typically, only inculpating evidence is presented.) When the grand jury declined to indict the officer, the prosecutor again took an unusual step of publicly releasing all the evidence the grand jury had considered.

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The grand jury transcripts revealed a number of additional anomalies: Although the prosecutors did not press police officers about contradictions in their testimony, prosecutors did challenge certain eyewitnesses about inconsistencies. Also breaking with typical procedure, the prosecutor did not suggest which charges the grand jury should consider, instead leaving it up to the grand jurors to decide. In addition, the Assistant district attorney gave the grand jurors inaccurate instructions concerning when an officer can legally kill a fleeing suspect. And, the prosecutor presented evidence to the grand jury he must have known to be false—specifically, he called a woman who “clearly wasn’t present when this occurred” to testify as an eyewitness.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">You are a prosecutor in a large city. You must decide which (if either) of two suspects to charge in the brutal killing of a police officer. The facts are as follows.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Shortly after midnight on the night of the killing, police officers Robert Wood and Teresa Turko pulled over an automobile to tell the driver that his lights were off. Wood and Turko were unaware that the car had been stolen a few days earlier by sixteen-year-old David Harris. When Wood reached the car, its driver shot him dead and sped off. Officer Turko was unable to get its license number or to describe the driver.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Harris was arrested a month later after boasting to friends that he had been involved in the highly publicized murder. In the course of questioning, he acknowledged having stolen the car, and he ultimately directed the police to the murder weapon—a .22 caliber pistol that he had stolen from his father and concealed in a bayou that washed off any fingerprints.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">However, Harris denied having committed the murder. He accused a twenty-eight-year-old drifter named Randall Adams of committing the offense. According to Harris, he had picked up Adams hitchhiking and they had spent the day together. They had gotten a bite to eat, drunk a few beers, smoked some marijuana, and watched some pornographic movies. Harris said that Adams was driving the car when the police officers pulled them over; Harris, who knew that the car was stolen, slumped down in the seat to avoid being seen. Next, he said, Adams reached under the seat to where he had seen a pistol, grabbed it, and killed Officer Wood. On Harris’s account, they parted at Adams’s motel, with Adams telling Harris to forget all about what had happened.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Randall Adams was ultimately found and interrogated—and his story corroborates Harris’s up to a point, but only up to a point. According to Adams, after the food, marijuana, and movies, he returned to his motel at 10 p.m. and watched television for the rest of the night with his brother. The brother corroborates this, but the two have different recollections of what they watched that night. Adams’s brother has stated </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page443" class="pagebreak" title="443">443</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">that he does not wish to testify. Adams has no criminal record, while Harris has a lengthy juvenile record. Both seem sincere, and Harris is an appealing youth whom you believe will make a sympathetic impression on a jury.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The case has attracted considerable public attention, in part because the murder was unsolved for a month and in part because of its sheer cold-bloodedness. The public reaction strongly favors the death penalty for the killer; however, your state does not permit the death penalty for sixteen-year-olds.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">How do you proceed? According to the ABA’s Standards, do you have sufficient evidence to charge Harris? Adams? If you believe that the evidence is sufficient to charge either one, whom do you charge for Wood’s </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">killing? If you do not believe the evidence is sufficient, how do you explain to the media and the public that you have released both men despite the fact that one of them almost certainly killed Officer Wood?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Can considerations of whom you think a jury would be more willing to convict enter into your decision? If you charge Adams, how certain must you be of his guilt to seek the death penalty?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> operates quite differently from the process for disclosing evidence in civil suits. In the latter, where only money is typically involved, both sides are entitled to review all relevant documents and to depose one another’s witnesses, at length and under oath. Why are defendants entitled to more material in civil discovery than they are in the criminal system, where liberty is at stake?</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many judges and commentators have criticized prosecutors’ limited discovery obligations. Giving voice to these objections, Professor David Luban observes:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> . . . holds only that the prosecution must turn over exculpatory material to the defense. The defense still has no right to depose prosecution witnesses or even to interview an unwilling witness, and in some jurisdictions the prosecution lies under no obligation even to divulge the names of its witnesses to the defense. Nor need the prosecution divulge the results of scientific tests or expert evaluations unless the prosecutor believes these to be exculpatory</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although the principal rationale for this no-discovery procedural regime is the protection of prosecution witnesses, it appears to be justified as well by the ideal of adversary balance. After all, because of the defendant’s right against self-incrimination, the prosecution has no discovery rights. Fair is fair. But fair is not fair. In fact, the prosecution retains significant discovery rights. By obtaining a warrant, prosecutors and police can search the defendant’s possessions</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What follows from Professor Luban’s critique? Should courts or legislatures compel prosecutors to have an “open-file” policy? Some European nations specify that all police evidence must be made available to the defense, and a half-dozen states have adopted such open-file policies in the </span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> For example, Texas adopted the Michael Morton Act, which requires prosecutors to share case files and provide nearly all the evidence in those files to the defense “as soon as practicable.” Similarly, five exonerations from death row spurred the North Carolina legislature to pass an open-file law, which compels prosecutors to share “any other matter or evidence obtained during the investigation of the defendant.” Initially, prosecutors resisted and resented the new requirements. But a 2016 study, published in the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Washington and Lee Law Review</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, found that, after a period of adjustment, 91 percent of prosecutors and 70 percent of defense lawyers reported satisfaction with the new policies. According to one North Carolina district attorney: “Prosecutors can have blind spots. We get so convinced that the defendant is guilty. We really can’t be the architects of deciding what’s helpful to the defense and what’s not. Now they decide. In the end, that’s liberating.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, in the federal system, at least ten U.S. District Courts have expressly eliminated the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> materiality requirement. A number of additional Districts require prosecutors to turn over more than the Supreme Court would require—but haven’t jettisoned materiality altogether.</span>

Some have. Says one big-city district attorney, who has adopted such a policy: “A lot of times, you show them what you’ve got, and it tells them they don’t have a chance. Or on the flip side, they can call you and say ‘I’ve found something out you might not know. Would it change your mind?’ And then we can talk.”</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Codified rules and existing case law governing a prosecutor’s conduct at trial are relatively bare-bones. They prohibit a prosecutor from: expressing a personal opinion; making arguments calculated to inflame the jury; arguing facts not in evidence; offering unreliable testimony; engaging in unduly harsh characterizations of the defense; and commenting on a defendant’s failure to testify. </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

Standard 3–3.5<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Standard 3–3.5&quot; \s &quot;Standard 3–3.5&quot; \c 16 " /></span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Even the Supreme Court has noted: “Serious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> As just one illustration, it is now clear that one criminal conviction was obtained after the prosecution argued that there was a “one in 10 million” chance that the hair sample found at the crime scene belonged to someone other than the defendant. In fact, one of the hairs turned out to be a dog’s.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">In light of these concerns, Professor Jane Moriarty proposes an amendment to Model Rule 3.8 to state:</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . make reasonable efforts to assure that only reliable expert evidence is admitted into evidence. A prosecutor shall not use evidence that she knows or reasonably should know is unreliable.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, Professor Moriarty suggests that the ABA Standards should be amended to state: “A prosecutor should not seek to rely upon unreliable expert testimony, particularly when such testimony would be important to a determination of guilt.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Confronting now-discredited toolmark evidence prior to the National Academy of Science’s influential 2009 report, now-retired U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Gertner faced an ethical dilemma. In <a id="dabmci_8f99f8c37d464c6db0171d4adb4ca924" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Green, United States v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;22;dabmci_8f99f8c37d464c6db0171d4adb4ca924_1;I6a7374d971bd11daa20eccddde63d628;;0;F;United States v. Green, 405 F. Supp. 2d 104 (D. Ma. 2005)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Green</span>, 405 F. Supp. 2d 104 (D. Ma. 2005), Judge Gertner acknowledged that toolmark identification testimony ought not be considered admissible under <span style="font-style: italic;">Daubert</span>. But the judge pointed out that “the problem,” which was that “notwithstanding all of the serious deficiencies . . . <span style="font-style: italic;">every single court</span> post-<span style="font-style: italic;">Daubert</span> has admitted this testimony, sometimes without any searching review, much less a hearing.” <a id="dabmci_a0de3f9c438344568ba38259d37a597b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 108. Judge Gertner thus allowed the prosecution’s expert to describe the similarities between the shell casings at issue, but she stopped short of permitting him to testify that there was a definitive match. The judge explained:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">I reluctantly [admit the evidence] because of my confidence that any other decision will be rejected by appellate courts, in light of precedents across the country, regardless of the findings I have made. While I recognize that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Daubert-Kumho</span> standard does not require the illusory perfection of a television show (CSI, this wasn’t), when liberty hangs in the balance—and, in the case of the defendants facing the death penalty, life itself—the standards should be higher than were met in this case, and than have been imposed across the country. The more courts admit this type of toolmark evidence without requiring documentation, proficiency testing, or evidence of reliability, the more sloppy practices will endure; we should require more.</p>

Was Judge Gertner’s compromise decision defensible? What about the prosecutor’s reliance on such testimony? How much are judges to blame for the introduction of unreliable evidence?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another way that prosecutors can subvert the justice system is by offering the testimony of unreliable jailhouse informants, another leading source of wrongful convictions.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1036" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1036" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">168</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">One way to combat problems with jailhouse testimony is to create a central review system. For example, starting in 1989, Los Angeles instituted a stringent policy for the admission of jailhouse informant testimony. The policy establishes that, prior to admitting such testimony, prosecutors must obtain approval from a jailhouse informant committee headed by the chief assistant district attorney. Rather than being a rubber stamp, data suggests that the committee’s oversight is strict and approvals are exceedingly rare. Furthermore, the policy requires prosecutors to: present strong corroborative evidence beyond the fact that the informant appears to know details of the crime thought to be known only to law enforcement; record all interviews of in-custody informants; and receive specialized training on the risks associated with this type of testimony. Finally, Los Angeles maintains a central index of jailhouse informants, to ensure informants aren’t used repeatedly.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Another potential way to combat prosecutors’ willingness to introduce the testimony of unreliable informants is via a change to the Model Rules. Here, the late Professor Myrna Raeder advocated a new Model Rule requiring that “the prosecutor should only introduce evidence when he or she has a factual basis to objectively believe it is reliable.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">This story appeared in yesterday’s </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">New York Times</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">: a career prosecutor in New York City’s DA’s office, Daniel Bibb, was ordered to reexamine two men’s murder convictions because of new evidence. [The men, Hidalgo and Lemus, had been in prison for more than a decade for </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page452" class="pagebreak" title="452">452</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">a nightclub murder. During those years, evidence gradually accumulated that they were cases of mistaken identity. Pro bono lawyers and a New York City policeman painstakingly gathered evidence and pressured the DA’s office to reinvestigate the case.] After an exhaustive 21-month investigation, Bibb became convinced that they were not guilty. But he couldn’t persuade his superiors to drop the cases, so he went in to the hearing and, in his words, threw the case. “ ‘I did the best I could,’ he said. ‘To lose.’ ”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">He made sure that the exculpatory witnesses showed up at the hearing, told witnesses what questions he was going to ask them on cross-examination, and helped defense lawyers draw connections between different pieces of evidence when they weren’t getting it. All the while, he continued to ask his superiors to drop the cases. They agreed to do so for one of the men, and a new trial was ordered for the other. At that point, Bibb said, “I’m done. . . . I wanted nothing to do with it.” Bibb eventually resigned. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Stephen Gillers, a nationally-renowned legal ethics expert, thinks he did [wrong], and might face professional discipline. “He’s entitled to his conscience, but his conscience does not entitle him to subvert his client’s case. It entitles him to withdraw from the case, or quit if he can’t.” Bibb, on the other hand, said that he didn’t withdraw because “he worried that if he did not take the case, another prosecutor would—and possibly win.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I have great admiration for Steve Gillers, but in this case I think he’s wrong. Daniel Bibb deserves a medal, not a reprimand.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Before I explain why, let’s see what the ethics case against Bibb might be. Imagine that a private lawyer representing a private client did the same thing: located truthful but adverse witnesses, revealed his cross-examination, coached the opposing lawyers. And suppose his client lost. The lawyer did it because he thought the other side was right. First, there is no question that the lawyer could be sued for malpractice. As for ethics violations, the lawyer could be charged with violating the requirement of competency (Model Rule 1.1); the requirement that the client, not the lawyer, sets the goals of the representation (Rule 1.2(a)); the requirement of diligence (“zeal,” although the Model Rules don’t use that word in Rule 1.3); and the conflict of interest provision (Rule 1.7). Conceivably the lawyer could also be charged with using client confidences against the client’s interests, if any of his conduct was based on confidential information from the client. In short, a mountain of ethics violations.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Presumably, the same could be said of a prosecutor. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But there is a difference. Prosecutors aren’t supposed to win at all costs. In a time-honored formula, their job is to seek justice, not victory. It’s a mantra that appears in all the crucial ethics documents: in the current ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (“A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate.” </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page453" class="pagebreak" title="453">453</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Comment to Model Rule 3.8); in the previous ABA Code of Professional Responsibility (“The responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate: his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict” (EC 7</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="color: #000000;">Admittedly, there’s a Delphic quality to “seek justice, not victory.</span>“ ‘<span style="color: #000000;">Justice’ is a grandiose and vague word. (Holmes famously said “This is a court of law, young man, not a court of justice,” and wrote that whenever someone starts talking about justice he knows that legal thinking has come to an end.) The actual ethics rules—as opposed to aspirational standards—take a pretty minimalist view of the prosecutor’s responsibilities. They shouldn’t proceed without probable cause, they should make a reasonable effort to ensure that the accused has been informed of his rights, they shouldn’t try to get an unrepresented person to waive rights, and they should do timely </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span><span style="color: #000000;"> disclosures. That’s about it. . . .</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">And yet I’ve talked with a lot of prosecutors who take “seek justice, not victory” seriously, even if they aren’t 100% confident they know exactly what it requires. At the very least, they know it means that you shouldn’t try to keep people behind bars if you think they didn’t do it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">And just this year, the ABA House of Delegates agreed. The ABA added two new Model Rules to deal with prosecutors’ obligations when new evidence suggests that they obtained wrongful convictions. Rule 3.8(g)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8(g)&quot; \s &quot;3.8(g)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> requires a prosecutor who learns of “new, credible, and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not commit an offense of which the defendant was convicted,” to disclose the evidence to the proper authorities as well as the defendant, and initiate an investigation. And Rule 3.8(h)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8(h)&quot; \s &quot;3.8(h)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> requires a prosecutor who receives clear and convincing evidence that a defendant was convicted of a crime he did not commit to “seek to remedy the conviction.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What, after all, did Bibb do wrong? He persuaded witnesses to show up in court and testify (against the state). Think for a moment about the alternative. Bibb was charged with investigating the case, and he did a </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page454" class="pagebreak" title="454">454</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">yeoman’s job to locate the witnesses. Bibb “and two detectives conducted more than 50 interviews in more than a dozen states, ferreting out witnesses the police had somehow missed or ignored.” Once he had these witnesses’ evidence, he was under an obligation to turn it over to the defense.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The alternatives: don’t investigate the case for fear you’ll find out that the guys doing 25-years-to-life are innocent; or, having investigated it, don’t turn over the exculpatory evidence to the defense, violating your constitutional and ethical obligations; or, having turned it over, put the defense to the difficulty of locating the witnesses and getting them to court—so, if they don’t succeed, the truth stays buried. THAT’s the ethical obligation of a public prosecutor?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Admittedly, it’s weirder to have the prosecutor remind the defense about how the evidence fits together, and weirder still to tell witnesses what you’re planning to ask them on cross examination. But how does that subvert criminal justice? How does that harm anybody or violate anyone’s interests?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This is the real question. Steve Gillers says that Bibb subverted his client’s case. But who is his client? . . . The court record says that a prosecutor’s client is the “people” or “state” of New York. That doesn’t help much, but it helps some. It helps us to focus on the question of why the people or state of New York have an interest in two innocent men serving long prison terms. . . . The fact is that Bibb didn’t harm any discernible interest of his client. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To “seek justice, not merely to convict” means that prosecutors aren’t supposed to be the ruthless partisan warriors the adversary system presupposes. Bibb was in a tough spot—ordered, for whatever reason, to defend convictions that he thought were wrong. He became a conscientious objector on the battlefield. His way out was unusual enough to land him on the front page of the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">New York Times</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. But he did the right thing, and hopefully THAT isn’t unusual.</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Professor Luban’s blog post explains, in 2008, the ABA House of Delegates amended Rule 3.8<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.8&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> to deal with the question of actual innocence. Pursuant to Rule 3.8(g)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8(g)&quot; \s &quot;3.8(g)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, a prosecutor who learns of “new, credible, and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not commit an offense of which the defendant was convicted,” </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">must</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> disclose the evidence to the proper authorities as well as the defendant, and initiate an investigation.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Furthermore, Rule 3.8(h)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8(h)&quot; \s &quot;3.8(h)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> now requires a prosecutor who receives clear and convincing evidence that a defendant in the prosecutor’s jurisdiction was convicted of a crime he did not commit to “seek to remedy the conviction.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1048" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1048" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">180</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> However, only a minority of states have, </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page455" class="pagebreak" title="455">455</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">so far, adopted the revised Rule 3.8<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8&quot; \s &quot;3.8&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> And, the requirements are not necessarily as strong as they appear at first blush. A Comment explains that if the prosecutor makes a “good faith” and “independent judgment” that the new evidence does not “trigger the obligations of sections (g) and (h),” then there is no rule violation.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> This appears to be true even if a court later finds that the prosecutor’s determination was erroneous and objectively unreasonable.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Should that be the standard?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Several commenters on this blog post disagreed with Luban’s conclusions. They were disturbed by the fact that Bibb had violated the instructions of his superiors to defend the convictions. Ethics expert John Steele wrote:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Should the subordinate lawyer accede to the supervisor’s orders and try the case, ask to be moved to another case, resign from the organization, or secretly subvert the supervisor’s orders while pretending to follow them?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The only answer I can’t support is the last one. It’s deceit on the supervisor, deceit on the organization, and deceit on the court.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Professor Martin Lederman agreed:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The prosecutor here was the elected Manhattan D.A., who chose to go ahead with the prosecution. . . . At that point, Bibb is acting as an agent of the D.A. If he firmly believes his supervisor was wrong, Steele is correct that he can—perhaps should—ask to be removed from the case, or resign. If he thinks the D.A. is willfully acting unlawfully, perhaps he should even make a stink about to the relevant authorities or in public.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But act as an unfaithful agent? . . . [I]t’s a violation of one’s contract with the principal, a violation of agency principles, and, as you concede, a fraud on the D.A.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Professor Stephen Gillers also weighed in:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Morgenthau [the District Attorney] speaks for the client, the People. He was elected, not Bibb. . . . The buck has to stop somewhere and it stops with the elected D.A., who has final discretion. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Would [Professor Luban] support a Bibb-like act in the next case if another assistant threw the case honestly convinced that it is what justice required, ignoring contrary instruction, and it turned out that the freed person really was factually guilty? We law professors have the luxury of living in a more or less hierarchy-free world, but </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page456" class="pagebreak" title="456">456</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">in the ‘real life’ of big law offices, including government ones, hierarchy is process.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In a subsequent article on the case, Luban responded to these questions:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20.7pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I agree that if you work in an organization—at any rate a decent organization—you should generally respect the chain of command. And if your supervisors reach a different conclusion than you about the same evidence, you should earnestly consider whether their judgment might be better or more objective than yours.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 20.7pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But sometimes it may happen that your certainty remains unshakeable even when you have tried as hard as you can to see it their way. And sometimes the magnitude of the injustice is intolerable. Lastly, once in a great while, nobody can stop the injustice but you. At that point, the demands of conscience, and indeed of human decency, prevail over the office hierarchy.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the Palladium case, no prosecutor knew the facts and evidence as well as Bibb. He had met the witnesses, he had spent hours sizing them up, he had lived with the case for two years. Of course as an abstract matter he could have read the evidence wrong and his supervisors could have been right. But in the real world, this abstract possibility was negligible. His supervisors had little or nothing to go on except the information that Bibb gave them [which included the identities of the actual killer and his accomplices]. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As for the size of the injustice: if Bibb was right, two innocent men had spent 14 years in prison for a crime they hadn’t committed, and were looking at many more years. The injustice doesn’t get much grosser than that. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Finally, Bibb feared that no other prosecutor could have or would have gotten all the witnesses to testify. If he withdrew, Lemus and Hidalgo might still be in prison.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1052" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1052" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">184</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Who has the better argument, Luban or his critics?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Lemus and Hidalgo were ultimately exonerated. Both of them sued for wrongful imprisonment, and each collected more than $1 million. They had served fourteen years in prison. The lawsuits asserted that, nearly from the beginning, the police ignored evidence that another man, Thomas “Spanky” Morales, was the actual shooter and that the DA’s office had dragged its feet for years before agreeing to reinvestigate the case. Morales was eventually indicted for the murder, but his indictment was dismissed because of a speedy trial act violation.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As the above reading suggests, some prosecutors fail to “do justice.” Some charge indiscriminately, others breach their </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> disclosure </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">obligations, and still others use a heavy hand while coaching friendly witnesses. Indeed, evidence indicates that prosecutorial misconduct happens with unnerving frequency. In two-thirds of the death penalty cases in which defendants have recently been exonerated by DNA evidence, misconduct by the police or prosecutors played a role.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1053" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1053" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">185</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Other investigations have uncovered convictions that were secured based on perjured testimony, fabricated evidence, suggestive identification procedures, dishonest jailhouse informants, and biased and incompetent scientific experts.</span>

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet, formal oversight of prosecutorial conduct has generally been lax. Concerns about separation of powers, together with the absence of legal standards for assessing discretionary decisions, have made courts reluctant to second-guess many prosecutorial actions. Further, as </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Olsen v. United States</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> (below) indicates, most judges have been unwilling to overturn defendants’ convictions, even in the face of egregious lapses, typically on the ground that the violations are harmless error.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Disciplinary proceedings are similarly exceptional—even in the face of egregious misconduct.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1055" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1055" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">187</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Defendants, defense counsel, and judges generally have few incentives to file complaints, and bar enforcement agencies—facing severe resource constraints—have few incentives to proceed on their own initiative, particularly since such charges are likely to be contentious, controversial, and costly to litigate.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Other penalties for prosecutorial misconduct are available but very seldom imposed. These include suppression of unethically-obtained evidence, dismissal of cases, or disqualification for conflicts of interest.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1056" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1056" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">188</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Political accountability is equally limited. Although state D.A.s are generally elected and U.S. Attorneys are high-level political appointees, their subordinates are not. The vast majority of enforcement decisions are neither publicized nor memorable. Nor are most voters and politicians who control appointments adequately informed about the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">complex considerations underlying many enforcement practices. That is not to deny the influence of public opinion on some prosecutorial decisions. But where political considerations play a role, they often reinforce pressures to win cases at the expense of other values.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Connick v. Thompson</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, illustrates how far-reaching prosecutorial immunity can be. The case involved the prosecution’s failure to turn over blood sample evidence exonerating John Thompson from a murder charge in connection with an armed robbery. Thompson spent fourteen years on death row before an investigator happened to discover that the blood sample from the crime scene failed to match Thompson’s. Thompson’s conviction was overturned and he was acquitted on retrial. He then sued the D.A. for failing to train prosecutors in their disclosure obligations. Evidence in the case indicated that, in the decade preceding the trial, Louisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> violations—and, as Justice Ginsburg later observed, “Connick’s office had one of the worst </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> records in the country.” </span>

But, in a five-four decision, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the D.A. could not be liable for the single act of an errant prosecutor. </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, 704 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir. 2013)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. Olsen admitted that he produced ricin, a highly toxic poison, but argued that he didn’t intend to use it as a weapon. Instead, he claimed that he was motivated by “an irresponsible sense of curiosity” about “strange and morbid things.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To show that Olsen acted with the requisite intent, the government produced a bottle of allergy pills found among Olsen’s possessions. An analysis by Washington State Police (WSP) forensic scientist Arnold Melnikoff determined that these pills might contain ricin. Because Melnikoff’s lab wasn’t equipped to test for ricin, Melnikoff sent the pills to the FBI, which confirmed his suspicion. According to the government, these spiked allergy pills were tangible proof that Olsen intended to use the poison as a weapon.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Olsen tried to cast doubt on this evidence by arguing that the pills were contaminated by Melnikoff before he sent them to the FBI. There was evidence that Melnikoff “handled and extensively manipulated” the pills. Melnikoff admitted to examining the pills “not by individually removing them from the bottle with forceps, but rather by dumping them onto his laboratory bench, albeit on ‘a sheet of clean lab paper,’ after he had examined other items on the same bench—which included scraping ricin-positive powder from some of these items.” This was especially important because the ricin test destroyed the pills, so we can’t tell whether the poison was inside them or merely on their surface. As a result, Melnikoff’s competence and veracity were critical to the government’s case. Unfortunately for the prosecution, however, there were many reasons to doubt both.</span>

      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page460" class="pagebreak" title="460">460</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Before joining the WSP, Melnikoff ran the Montana State Crime Laboratory. While there, he conducted a hair sample analysis that resulted in the conviction of Jimmy Ray Bromgard for raping an 8-year-old girl. When a DNA analysis exonerated Bromgard after he had spent fifteen years in prison, officials in Washington and Montana took note. So did the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">New York Times</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. Washington launched an investigation into Melnikoff’s “misconduct involving courtroom testimony and/or case analysis,” which was expanded after state officials discovered that another innocent Montana inmate had been wrongfully convicted based on flaws in Melnikoff’s work. A month before Olsen’s trial began, a third Montana inmate was exonerated on similar grounds.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The findings of the WSP’s investigation were compiled into a highly critical report: The panel of experts who prepared it doubted “Melnikoff’s diligence and care in the laboratory, his understanding of the scientific principles about which he testified in court, and his credibility on the witness stand.” The report also contained an extensive review of Melnikoff’s work in Washington, recommending that the WSP redo lab work in 14 out of 100 randomly selected cases due to “the presence of unexplained contaminants in his laboratory, among other findings.” A few quotes from the report illustrate its force:</span>

          <span id="Element47" style="color: #000000;" />
          <span style="color: #000000;">[T]here were many mistakes in case documentation, administrative documentation, evidence analysis, data interpretation, and written reports, for example. The casework analysis seemed to be built around speed and shortcuts. . . . [M]any of the results, collected as they were, were not necessarily sufficient to prove the identity of the questioned substance. Often the data was weak and there was an overreliance of basing identification from mixtures without taking the steps to separate the components. </span>
          <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">There were often contaminants or unexplained material in the blanks</span>
          <span style="color: #000000;">, and these contaminants were often not noted or identified, and no obvious attempt was made to remove them.</span>

          <span style="color: #000000;">There was a tendency for conclusions to become stronger as the case developed, from notes to written report to testimony.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Melnikoff’s employment with the WSP was eventually terminated, and the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed the termination based on a “finding that Melnikoff was incompetent and committed gross misconduct.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Olsen’s lawyer knew that an investigation was underway, but he didn’t know its scope. Nor did he know that the WSP’s report had been completed and sent to the state decisionmaker two months before Olsen’s trial began. Rather than inform defense counsel and the court of these important developments, the Assistant U.S. Attorney prosecuting the case materially understated the scope, status and gravity of the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page461" class="pagebreak" title="461">461</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">investigation. . . . Melnikoff’s lawyer, Rocco Treppiedi, made an appearance and represented that the WSP was “in the process of investigating” the matter and that, as of that time, there was “absolutely no evidence, no allegation that Mr. Melnikoff has ever done anything inappropriate with respect to anything other than his opinion testimony on the hair sampling.” The Assistant U.S. Attorney added that the WSP investigation was ongoing and represented that “[t]here is nothing further that you should know about.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Each of these statements was contradicted by the WSP report. But because the Assistant U.S. Attorney failed to disclose the contents of the report to the district judge, the judge relied heavily on the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s inaccurate representations in evaluating Olsen’s request to cross-examine Melnikoff about the investigation. The judge stated: “[L]et me just say a few words about my understanding of this, </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">and counsel should check me if I am wrong</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">.” He then said that “[t]he only issue here involved at all is whether or not there was some inaccuracy regarding his testimony in Montana about comparing hair samples on rape and homicide cases,” and that “there is nothing in here that I see that indicates that there was any problem at all during the state—his tenure with the State of Washington.” He summarized: “There has been no investigation—or at least no conclusions. They are just bare allegations involving hair sample analyses, the subject of which is not in any way involved in this case.” The district judge surmised that Melnikoff’s forced administrative leave during the investigation must have been taken “out of an abundance of precaution.” He then asked, “[W]here am I off the track?”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Nearly everything the district judge understood to be true was false. But the prosecutor did not correct the district judge, who then concluded that it would be “unfair to Mr. Melnikoff to allow counsel to delve into this issue” and “under an analysis of </span>
        <a id="dabmci_2b6e346784ba480f88e0dc3321c49201" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />

        <span style="color: #000000;">, it just would be improper to go into that.” As a result, the government introduced the spiked allergy pills and the jury heard Melnikoff’s testimony, all without ever being informed of these serious doubts about their reliability.</span>

By this, the prosecutor meant the ambiguous evidence of a year’s worth of Olsen’s Internet browsing. In an investigation that would have made Big Brother green with envy, the government produced 20,000 pages showing the websites Olsen visited and the searches he performed. During that year, Olsen visited sites relating to ricin and other poisons. He printed materials from these pages and ordered works with menacing titles such as: “ ‘How to Kill,’ ‘Silent Death,’ ‘Getting Even,’ and the ‘Poisoner’s Handbook.’ ” Olsen also searched for “ ‘silent killers,’ ‘death by poison,’ ‘tasteless poison,’ ‘hidden poison,’ ‘undetectable poisons,’ ‘untraceable poisons’ . . . ‘deadly sleeping pills,’ and ‘common ingredients for death by sleep.’ ”</span>

        <a id="dabmci_5927ce1a7e5a4e179bc6d37815445202" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />

        <span style="color: #000000;">. at 1186</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, it’s surprising that these “thoughts” don’t shed light on the intended victim (or victims?). Surely somewhere in the 20,000 pages of Internet proxy logs Olsen searched for “what to wear to your boss’s funeral” or “how to file a widower’s tax return,” or maybe he watched “How to Murder Your Wife” on Netflix. But the opinion makes no mention of it, which makes the materiality analysis that much weaker.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This is hardly the “overwhelming” evidence of intent that the panel promises. The evidence is consistent with Olsen’s intent to use the ricin as a weapon, of course, but it’s also consistent with the irresponsible curiosity that Olsen claims motivated him. The pills shed an entirely different light on the matter. They demonstrate that Olsen moved beyond curiosity and took concrete steps to use the poison. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Had the jury seen the WSP report or been told of its contents, it may well have developed doubts about whether Olsen poisoned the allergy pills. But without the report, without any indication that Melnikoff’s work had been condemned as incompetent by a panel of experts, without any indication that contaminating samples through careless handling was Melnikoff’s modus operandi, the jury had no reason to doubt that it was Olsen who contaminated the allergy pills. And, once the jury believed Olsen went so far as to spike the pills, all the remaining, otherwise ambiguous evidence falls into place as further corroboration of his ill intent.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">
        <span style="color: #000000;">III</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The panel’s ruling is not just wrong, it is dangerously broad, carrying far-reaching implications for the administration of criminal justice. It effectively announces that the prosecution need not produce exculpatory or impeaching evidence so long as it’s </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">possible</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the defendant would’ve been convicted anyway. This will send a clear signal to prosecutors that, when a case is close, it’s best to hide evidence helpful to the defense, as there will be a fair chance reviewing courts will look the other way, as happened here.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A robust and rigorously enforced </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> rule is imperative because all the incentives prosecutors confront encourage them not to discover or disclose exculpatory evidence. Due to the nature of a </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> violation, it’s highly unlikely wrongdoing will ever come to light in the first place. This creates a serious moral hazard for those prosecutors who are more interested in winning a conviction than serving justice. In the rare event that the suppressed evidence does surface, the consequences usually leave the prosecution no worse than had it complied with </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> from the outset. Professional discipline is rare, and violations seldom give rise to liability for money damages. </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">See, e.g., </span>
        <a id="dabmci_a16552ec671742dc8fcf9247d3bdaee2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />

        <span style="color: #000000;">decades of his life behind bars is practically unheard of. . . . If the violation is found to be material (a standard that will almost never be met under the panel’s construction), the prosecution gets a do-over, making it no worse off than if it had disclosed the evidence in the first place.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Olsen’s prosecution highlights the problem. The prosecutor just did not take his constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence very seriously. . . . [</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Editors’ Note</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">: Here, Judge Kozinski notes, in detail, that Elizabeth Brown, a lawyer affiliated with the Melnikoff investigation, repeatedly tried to contact the AUSA, but her calls were not returned.]</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Is there any doubt that if the Assistant U.S. Attorney had thought Brown had </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">inculpatory</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> evidence to provide him, he would have managed to connect with her? Or if these messages had been from a doctor or broker or child’s schoolteacher? We can be sure that the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have found the time for an extra phone call. But protecting the constitutional rights of the accused was just not very high on this prosecutor’s list of priorities. The fact that a constitutional mandate elicits less diligence from a government lawyer than one’s daily errands signifies a systemic problem: Some prosecutors don’t care about </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> because courts don’t make them care.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I wish I could say that the prosecutor’s unprofessionalism here is the exception, that his propensity for shortcuts and indifference to his ethical and legal responsibilities is a rare blemish and source of embarrassment to an otherwise diligent and scrupulous corps of attorneys staffing prosecutors’ offices across the country. But it wouldn’t be true. Brady violations have reached epidemic proportions in recent years, and the federal and state reporters bear testament to this unsettling trend. [Here, Judge Kozinski compiled over two-dozen representative cases, exhibiting this problem.]</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">When a public official behaves with such casual disregard for his constitutional obligations and the rights of the accused, it erodes the public’s trust in our justice system, and chips away at the foundational premises of the rule of law. When such transgressions are acknowledged yet forgiven by the courts, we endorse and invite their repetition.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Olsen’s case points to another important problem—that of rogue investigators and forensic experts. Melnikoff’s long history of misconduct, resulting in the wrongful conviction of numerous innocent people, is hardly unique. Just last month, Annie Dookhan, a Massachusetts crime-lab technician, was sentenced to 3–5 years imprisonment after spending several years filing positive results for samples she had not properly tested. Her misconduct tainted over 40,000 drug samples, implicating several thousand defendants (hundreds of whom have already been released). . . . Even the vaunted FBI Laboratory at Quantico, Virginia hasn’t been immune from charges of falsification and pro-prosecution bias. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page465" class="pagebreak" title="465">465</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Because modern criminal trials frequently turn on forensic reports, these incidents of misconduct raise the frightening prospect that many of the over 1.5 million people now populating state and federal prisons might, in fact, be innocent. How do rogue forensic scientists and other bad cops thrive in our criminal justice system? The simple answer is that some prosecutors turn a blind eye to such misconduct because they’re more interested in gaining a conviction than achieving a just result. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">We must send prosecutors a clear message: Betray </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, give short shrift to </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Giglio</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, and you will lose your ill-gotten conviction. Unfortunately, the panel’s decision sends the opposite message. The panel shrugs off an egregious </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> violation as immaterial. Had Melnikoff been fully impeached, the only evidence from which the prosecutor could’ve proven Olsen’s intent to use ricin as a weapon would have been a few Google searches and bookstore receipts. This is surely enough to show a reasonable probability of a different result. By raising the materiality bar impossibly high, the panel invites prosecutors to avert their gaze from exculpatory evidence, secure in the belief that, if it turns up after the defendant has been convicted, judges will dismiss the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> violation as immaterial.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On these facts, I would easily find a </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Brady</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> violation. My only question is whether the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s failure to discover the WSP report was willful or reckless, and if so, whether an Order to Show Cause should be entered inquiring why he and his supervisor should not be sanctioned. There is room for reasonable disagreement on this point, but I fail to see any plausible argument that the prosecutor did not violate Olsen’s constitutional rights when he failed to disclose evidence casting serious doubt on the reliability of the only dispositive piece of evidence in the case. By turning a blind eye to this grave transgression, the panel has shirked its own duty and compounded the violence done to the Constitution by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.</span>

The court responded:</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The Department of Justice has an obligation to its lawyers and to the public to prevent prosecutorial misconduct. Prosecutors, as servants of the law, are subject to constraints and responsibilities that do not apply to other lawyers; they must serve truth and justice first. Their job is not just to win, but to win fairly, staying within the rules. That did not happen here, and the district court swiftly and correctly declared a mistrial [given AUSA Jerry Albert’s ethical lapse].</span>

We declined to adopt the government’s suggestion and denied its motion. We have noticed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona regularly makes public the names of prosecutors who do good work and win important victories. . . .

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In a criminal justice system where vanishingly few cases go to trial, lawyers’ ethical responsibilities in plea bargaining assume outsized significance. Those responsibilities, like the bargaining process itself, provoke substantial dispute.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To some, plea bargaining is an invitation to injustice—a violation of individuals’ most fundamental rights and society’s most fundamental values. From this perspective, our elaborate constitutional protections serve largely as window-dressing for a system that, in fact, imposes </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">sanctions under a process resembling a street bazaar. John Langbein provocatively suggests that contemporary plea bargaining functions in much the same fashion as medieval torture. In medieval times, extorting confessions became an apparent necessity in order to bypass the continental criminal system’s idealistic but impractical prohibition against the use of circumstantial evidence. In Langbein’s view, the level of complexity and safeguards in our current criminal procedures has produced similar reliance on coercive methods. “Like the medieval Europeans,” he argues, “we have preserved an unworkable trial procedure in form, we have devised a substitute nontrial procedure to subvert the formal procedure, and we have arranged to place defendants under fierce pressure to ‘choose’ the substitute.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Others contend that the system is objectionable because it leads to “innocent defendants being offered (and taking) the same deals as guilty ones.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> In the view of still others, the system is problematic because it encourages sloppy lawyering, as any inadequacy in prosecutor’s or defense counsel’s preparation remains largely invisible when cases quickly settle. Since prosecutors are particularly disposed to plead their weakest cases, the incentives to forgo trial are strongest for those at greatest risk of an unjust conviction.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Defenders of plea bargaining concede that it is subject to abuse and that prosecutors operate with multiple objectives apart from pursuing justice: “[T]heir goal may be to enhance their personal batting average, to avoid a potentially embarrassing loss in a particular case . . . to cultivate good relationships with influential private attorneys, or simply to avoid staying too late at the office.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> But while acknowledging its flaws, defenders of plea bargaining believe that it is an acceptable, indeed essential, mechanism to conserve scarce judicial resources. These defenders point out that, although the plea-bargaining process may not always separate the innocent from the guilty, the same is true of trials, given evidentiary restrictions and juror biases. Furthermore, they note that defense lawyers are free to present exculpatory evidence during negotiations, and, if they lack the resources or incentive to do so, the same problems would emerge at trial. From this perspective, reform efforts should focus not on restricting plea bargaining, but, rather, on reducing caseloads and increasing resources and regulatory oversight of both prosecutors and defense counsel.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Ethical rules on lawyers’ press statements attempt to accommodate competing values. On the one hand, litigants have a right to an adjudication untainted by pretrial publicity. Without limits on such publicity, defendants would be tried and convicted in courts of public opinion—leading, some say, to the “practical nullification of the protective effect of the rules of forensic decorum and the exclusionary rules of evidence.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> On the other hand, individuals who are falsely accused have a strong interest in clearing their names, and the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that the public, in general, has a right to “guard against the miscarriage of justice by subjecting [the process] . . . to extensive public scrutiny and criticism.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">. There, a divided Court held that the speech of lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated, subject to certain limitations—and that the “substantial likelihood of material prejudice” standard is appropriately circumscribed. In the Court’s words, that test strikes “a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases and the State’s interest in fair trials.” </span>

      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The restraint on speech is narrowly tailored to achieve those objectives. The regulation of attorneys’ speech is limited—it applies only to speech that is substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect; it is neutral as to points of view, applying equally to all attorneys participating in a pending case; and it merely postpones the attorneys’ comments until after the trial. While supported by the substantial state interest in preventing prejudice to an adjudicative proceeding by those who have a duty to protect its integrity, the Rule is limited on its face to preventing only speech having a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing that proceeding.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The original justification—the fear of prejudicial publicity—simply does not exist with respect to defendants and their lawyers. The sixth amendment guarantees a fair trial to the defendant, not to the state, and the defendant’s exercise of first amendment rights poses no threat to that guarantee. More importantly, the accused has a first amendment right to reply publicly to the prosecutor’s charges, and the public has a right to hear that reply, because of its ongoing concern for the integrity of the criminal justice system and the need to hear from those most directly affected by it.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Despite the prohibition of intentional discrimination, prosecutors seemingly continue to target minority veniremembers with peremptory challenges. Studies of jury-selection patterns reveal shocking disparities in prosecutorial use of peremptory challenges against white and minority prospective jurors.

Between 2005 and 2009, in Houston County, Alabama, which is twenty-seven percent African American, prosecutors used peremptory challenges to eliminate eighty percent of African American veniremembers so that the resulting juries were either all white or had only one African American member. Exclusion of African Americans is not confined to the South. In Philadelphia, between 1981 and 1997, prosecutors in capital murder cases challenged fifty-one percent of African American veniremembers but only twenty-six percent of white veniremembers.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">[W]hen a defendant can establish a prima facie case, trial courts face the difficult burden of assessing prosecutors’ motives. Any prosecutor can easily assert facially neutral reasons for striking a juror, and trial courts are ill equipped to second-guess those reasons. How is the court to treat a prosecutor’s statement that he struck a juror because the juror had a son about the same age as defendant, or seemed “uncommunicative,” or “never cracked a smile” and, therefore “did not possess the sensitivities necessary to realistically look at the issues and decide the facts in this case?” If such easily generated explanations are sufficient to discharge the prosecutor’s obligation to justify his strikes on nonracial grounds, then the protection erected by the Court today may be illusory.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Nor is outright prevarication by prosecutors the only danger here. “[I]t is even possible that an attorney may lie to himself in an effort to convince himself that his motives are legal.” A prosecutor’s own conscious or unconscious racism may lead him easily to the conclusion that a prospective black juror is “sullen,” or “distant,” a characterization that would not have come to his mind if a white juror had acted identically. A judge’s own conscious or unconscious racism may lead him to accept such an explanation as well supported. As [the majority] concedes, prosecutors’ peremptories are based on their “seat-of-the-pants instincts” as to how particular jurors will vote. Yet “seat-of-the-pants instincts” may often be just another term for racial prejudice. Even if all parties approach the </span>

At the same time, McMahon reminded the trainees that they had to come up with a nonracial reason for their strikes.

Yet, he never received any public discipline, even though the State Supreme Court justices said that the third case “presents us with as strong a prima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Batson </span>challenge.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1084" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section18.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1084" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">216</a></span> Should disciplinary agencies be more willing to impose sanctions in order to provide deterrents to misconduct? What might account for their reluctance to do so? </p>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Suppose that you are an appellate judge in the case of Timothy Foster, an eighteen-year-old African American man convicted and sentenced to death for killing a seventy-nine-year-old white woman. At Timothy Foster’s 1987 trial in Rome, Georgia, the prosecutor used four of his nine peremptories to strike all the qualified African American jurors from the jury pool. Citing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Batson</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> (decided the year before), the defense objected, but the prosecutors offered nonracial justifications for the strikes, including that one juror had a “failure to make eye contact,” while another looked “bored,” while a third was “divorced.” Sometimes, too, the prosecutor’s story changed or was simply incredible. For example, prosecutors initially said they struck juror Eddie Hood because he had a son close to the defendant’s age. Later, when it turned out that two white jurors also had sons who were close in age to the defendant, the prosecutor gave a different “bottom line” reason: Hood was a member of the Church of Christ, and the prosecutor said that the Church of Christ was strongly anti-death penalty. (In fact, the Church of Christ takes no position on the death penalty, pro or con.) Similarly, prosecutors initially explained that they struck juror Marilyn Garrett because she was close in age to the defendant. But Foster was eighteen at the time of trial, while Garrett was thirty-four—and while supposedly objecting to Garrett’s age, the prosecution accepted eight white jurors under the age of thirty-five.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Twenty years after Foster’s conviction, and after decades of procedural wrangling, Foster’s lawyers finally obtained the prosecutors’ trial notes under the Georgia Open Records Act. In the notes, the name of each black prospective juror was highlighted in green, circled and labeled with a “B.” In addition, the first four names on a handwritten list of “Definite NOs” are those of the excluded black jurors. In a separate list, those jurors are ranked against one another, “in case it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Vigorously defending the prosecutor’s actions, the State of Georgia now contends that the only reason prosecutors labeled the race of the prospective African American jurors was to anticipate and rebut an all-but-inevitable </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Batson</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> challenge by the defendant. Further, the State contends:</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page478" class="pagebreak" title="478">478</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The State’s reasons, given both at trial and in sworn testimony in two subsequent proceedings, show that each black prospective juror had characteristics entirely apart from their race that would have put any prosecutor on notice that they may well be inclined against the State’s case. Foster’s attempted comparisons of white prospective jurors who served on the jury with the black prospective jurors ignore the multi-faceted nature of jury selection. Jurors possess multiple strengths and weaknesses from the perspective of the prosecution. It is the sum of the individual that the State assessed. It is not untoward that a venire member was selected as a juror even though that individual possessed a particular attribute cited by the prosecution as a reason for exercising a peremptory challenge on another juror.</span>
