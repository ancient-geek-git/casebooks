      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In his 1836 “Resolutions in Regard to Professional Deportment,” David Hoffman proposed the following prohibition against conflicts of interest: “If I have ever had any connection with a cause, I will never permit myself (when that connection is from any reason severed) to be engaged on the side of my former antagonist” (Resolution VIII). Yet the 19th century bar was not uniformly opposed to representing conflicting interests. A Georgia lawyer, criticized by acquaintances for representing the plaintiffs one day in a lawsuit and the defendant the following day, replied, “Consistency, thou art a jewel! I am not that jewel.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Even a lawyer as prominent as Daniel Webster represented several merchants against a debtor in 1805 while simultaneously representing that debtor in suits to collect overdue notes.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Today, the legal profession has the most elaborate conflict of interest regulations of any profession. Conflicts are among the most commonly litigated questions in legal ethics, and the organized bar has frequently debated the contours of the conflict of interest rules, and often amended them.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1092" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1092" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Why are conflicts of interest such an integral feature of American legal practice? One reason involves the size of private law firms and their organizational clients, together with their many branch offices. The larger the law firm, the greater the possibility of actual, attenuated, or inadvertent conflicts. Similarly, specialization in legal practice within and among firms has generated greater potential for simultaneous or successive representation of competing interests. The more technically complex the matter, the greater the premium placed on prior expertise, and the greater the likelihood that clients on all sides will seek an attorney who has had some previous involvement with the general subject-matter. So, too, lateral mobility among lawyers has led to an increase in circumstances that permit vicarious disqualification of colleagues under a doctrine that attributes one lawyer’s conflicts to others in the firm. Competition for clients can lead lawyers to accept work in the conflict-of-interest “gray zone” that turns out to be less gray than they thought.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page480" class="pagebreak" title="480">480</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although conflicts can arise in a wide variety of contexts, the three core situations involve: (1) representing multiple clients at the same time whose interests conflict; (2) representing one client against a former client in related matters; and (3) representing clients whose interests conflict with those of the attorney. These are, respectively, the problems of <span style="font-style: italic;">concurrent</span> (or <span style="font-style: italic;">simultaneous</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">representation</span> of conflicting interests, <span style="font-style: italic;">successive representation</span> of conflicting interests, and <span style="font-style: italic;">lawyer-client</span> conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Several key features of conflicts doctrine have also create the danger of conflicts of interest. First, mentioned above, is the doctrine of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">vicarious</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> or </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">imputed conflict of interest,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> which, under Rule 1.10, attributes lawyers’ conflicts to their partners and associates unless those conflicts arise from purely personal interests of the lawyer. This means that a single lawyer’s conflict of interest can disqualify hundreds of colleagues, unless the rules permit the conflicted lawyer to be screened from others in the firm and the required screening procedures are followed. The current Rule 1.10 allows a lawyer joining a new firm to be screened from cases in which the lawyer had previously represented adverse parties.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Imputed conflicts are particularly prevalent in large law firms. If a firm includes hundreds of lawyers who represent thousands of clients, it is quite likely that some member of the firm has represented a current client’s former adversary at some time, which raises successive representation issues. It is also increasingly possible that other attorneys in the firm—often in a branch office in another city—are providing unrelated services for that adversary at the same time, raising concurrent representation issues. Even forty years ago, a partner from the Wall Street firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell warned, “If the top lawyers from the top 10 firms in New York decided to form their own firm they probably would not be able to represent anyone.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1093" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1093" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This last remark points to a second singular feature of conflicts doctrine. The most typical remedy for a conflict of interest in litigation is not, as with most ethics rules, lawyer discipline after the fact. Rather, it is the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">disqualification</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> of the offending attorney before or during the representation. In a typical situation, Plaintiff, represented by Firm X, sues Defendant. Defendant moves to disqualify Plaintiff’s counsel because a lawyer working for Firm X had previously been part of a team assisting Defendant in a related matter. Defendant claims that the lawyer had access to confidential information about Defendant. If the court agrees, Firm X is disqualified. Then Plaintiff must engage new counsel and bring that counsel up to speed in the case. Moreover, if the court is convinced that Firm X lawyers have </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">used</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> confidential information about Defendant, the court will prohibit Firm X from turning </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page481" class="pagebreak" title="481">481</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">its work product over to Plaintiff’s successor counsel, adding further expense and delay.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">These two factors—the frequency of the ethical problem in large law firms and a powerful remedy that can be used tactically—help account for the prominence of conflicts. Large firms and their clients are especially likely to possess the resources to pursue satellite litigation, such as motions to disqualify opposing counsel. These motions can run up the adversary’s bill, remove an especially effective antagonist, delay trial, and increase pressures to settle.</span>

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Facing an epidemic of tactical abuse, the Supreme Court held in <a id="dabmci_af778f24689d4877ac0550e34890ffdb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Subsequent cases have held that decisions granting disqualification are also not subject to interlocutory appeal and courts have resisted invitations to provide immediate review, except in extraordinary circumstances.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1095" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1095" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> Although these decisions have curtailed the strategic uses of disqualification motions, such motions remain an important feature of contemporary practice. Canny clients may “plant” work in law firms in hopes of conflicting them out of representing the client’s adversaries.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It should be noted that conflicts of interest can also be a source of friction </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">within</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> law firms. From the point of view of individual partners in many law firms, there is a strong incentive to be the one bringing in the business: “Finders” or “rainmakers” are critically important to a firm’s economic well-being, and they are rewarded accordingly. Internal politicking among large-firm partners occurs regularly over which client the firm will represent when conflicts of interest preclude representing both. These “conflicts over conflicts” have exacerbated rivalries within firms and occasionally led to significant ethical abuses.</span>

          <a id="ftnb.1096" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1096" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a>

      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Ethical Rules</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Rules’ prohibition on concurrent conflicts of interests—explored below in Section A—is grounded in the twin fiduciary duties of loyalty and confidentiality. Concerns about loyalty extend beyond the particular matter for which the lawyer is retained. Thus, under Rule 1.7(a)(1), a lawyer may not represent a client if the representation would be directly adverse to another client, even if the two matters are legally unrelated, </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page482" class="pagebreak" title="482">482</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">because the effect on attorney-client relationships could be substantial. Even without direct adversity, loyalty concerns still persist. Rule 1.7(a)(2) prohibits a lawyer from simultaneously representing clients as long as “there is a significant risk” that the representation of one will be “materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer,” unless four delineated conditions are met.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">By contrast, in matters involving </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">former</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> clients, the lawyer owes continuing duties of confidentiality, but not loyalty, so representation is impermissible only in circumstances where the matters are sufficiently related to potentially threaten a breach of confidences. We explore duties to former clients below in Section B.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Other countries have similar provisions to address conflicts. Unlike the Model Rules, however, European rules generally do not permit clients to waive conflicts.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1097" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1097" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Japan and Great Britain have rules similar to those in the United States, although Japan also does not permit waivers in cases of actual conflict. Australia and New Zealand also prohibit conflicts of interest unless the client gives informed consent.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1098" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1098" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A preliminary word about conflicts of interest before we examine the particular doctrines: Every analysis must begin with the question, “Who is the client?” In some cases, where a lawyer represents an individual, the answer may be straightforward: The client is the person who signed the retainer agreement. Even then, however, complications can arise if someone else (for example, the client’s insurance company) is paying the fees and expects to have some say in the representation. When the lawyer is representing multiple members of a family—for example, by drafting wills for a married couple—the question may be harder still. And a lawyer representing an organization, who reports to members of management, may lose sight of whether the organization or its executives are the client—as illustrated by the</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;"> Spanier</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> case in Chapter 6, where damaging confusion arose about whether Penn State’s general counsel was representing the university or its president in a grand jury proceeding. In some cases, lawyers playing a mediating role in an organization or among parties say they are representing “the situation.” In reading the materials in this chapter, keep in mind that “who is the client?” may not always have a straightforward answer.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The following Rule sets out the fundamental prohibition on concurrent conflicts.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;">Rule 1.7—Conflict of Interest: Current Clients</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the representation is not prohibited by law;</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Rule is structured in two parts. Section (a) defines what constitutes a concurrent conflict, while section (b) specifies when a lawyer can represent clients despite the concurrent conflict. There are two types of concurrent conflicts: (a)(1) defines conflicts based on direct adversity between two clients, while (a)(2) defines conflicts more broadly based on whether a lawyer’s representation will be “materially limited” by another obligation or interest of the lawyer. We will discuss both types of conflicts, but there are two important points to make here. First, the existence of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">either</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> type of conflict triggers the Rule. Second, the existence of a concurrent conflict does not automatically preclude representation; rather, it requires that the lawyer meet the requirements of 1.7(b). These determine whether the conflict is “consentable,” meaning that the client can consent to the representation, despite the conflict. If the conflict is consentable, the lawyer must then obtain the client’s informed consent.</span>
      </p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Direct Adversity</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It seems obvious that, per Rule 1.7(a)(1), a lawyer cannot represent both sides in an adversarial proceeding, and cases raising that issue are </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">understandably rare. The most common exception is in the area of uncontested divorces, where couples may want to save money by hiring only one lawyer, rather than two. If the couple has negotiated a property division, courts will often permit the joint representation if the judge agrees that the property division is fair, provided the two clients have given their informed consent to the arrangement.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Amicable divorces do not necessarily stay amicable. What if, during the pendency of the divorce, amity unravels because one spouse discovers that the other has been having an affair or one spouse physically assaults the other? The moment the divorce turns contentious, the lawyer will have to withdraw from representing either spouse. Because divorces are inherently volatile, some courts caution divorcing spouses against representation by a single lawyer, and some prohibit it.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">United States v. Bronston</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, 658 F.2d 920 (2d Cir. 1981)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, a New York City lawyer and state senator, Jack Bronston, wished to represent a famous financier in a bid for a municipal contract. Bronston was told by his firm that he could not represent him, because the firm was already representing the financier’s competitors bidding for the same contract. Reluctant to give up his client, Bronston assisted the financier and concealed the representation. His actions turned out to be not only an ethical violation, but a crime: Bronston was convicted of two counts of mail fraud, one for each of the letters he wrote on the financier’s behalf.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">But the prohibition on a representation directly adverse to another client is not restricted to cases where the two clients are on opposite sides of the same legal matter. Rule 1.7 prohibits </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">any</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> concurrent representation of one client against another, even in unrelated matters. Thus, a lawyer who represents A in business matters cannot represent B in a suit against A resulting from an automobile accident, even though the two matters are entirely unrelated. The rationale is to avoid perceived disloyalty. As Comment 6 to Rule 1.7 explains: “The client as to whom the representation is directly adverse is likely to feel betrayed, and the resulting damage to the client-lawyer relationship is likely to impair the lawyer’s ability to represent the client effectively.”</span>

O’Donnell explained that he might be forced to argue that the trial judge had erred by stating he was required to give “great weight” to a 10–2 jury vote in favor of imposing the death penalty on Williams. In a pending case involving a different client, O’Donnell had argued in a brief that the Supreme Court </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> For example, in one widely publicized case, a large firm withdrew from pro bono representation of New York City in a claim against gun manufacturers because, according to a firm statement, the case posed “certain potential positional conflicts.” However, as several legal experts noted, the firm’s decision seemed to be based on economic, not ethical, concerns.

Neither the Rules nor its predecessor, the Code of Professional Responsibility, explicitly forbid positional conflicts of interest. Yet, the Rules include provisions that implicitly prohibit such conflicts in two situations. First, if a positional conflict risks the misuse of a client’s confidences, it is impermissible under Rule 1.6. Second, if it would “materially limit” the representation of one or the other client, a positional conflict is impermissible under Rule 1.7(a)(2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.7(a)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.7(a)(2)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">[24]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ordinarily a lawyer may take inconsistent legal positions in different tribunals at different times on behalf of different clients. The mere fact that advocating a legal position on behalf of one client might create precedent adverse to the interests of a client represented by the lawyer in an unrelated matter does not create a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists, however, if there is a significant risk that a lawyer’s action on behalf of one client will materially limit the lawyer’s effectiveness in representing another client in a different case; for example, when a decision favoring one client will create a precedent likely to seriously weaken the position taken on behalf of the other client. Factors relevant in determining whether the clients need to be advised of the risk include: where the cases are pending, whether the issue is substantive or procedural, the temporal relationship between the matters, the significance of the issue to the immediate and long-term interests of the clients involved and the clients’ reasonable expectations in retaining the lawyer. If there is significant risk of material limitation, then absent informed consent of the affected clients, the lawyer must refuse one of the representations or withdraw from one or both matters.</span>

But others worry that a broader prohibition might chill firms’ willingness to undertake law reform and pro bono work. The American bar has long pointed with pride to examples of lawyers who, as advocates for paying clients, exploited loopholes in the law, but who later volunteered their efforts to plug these loopholes.</span>

If knowledge of the loophole comes in part </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">from</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the paying client, should the lawyer be able to provide a plug?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Rules address problematic questions of lawyer participation in law reform in two rules, 6.3 and 6.4. Rule 6.3 states that lawyers may participate as directors, officers, or members of a legal services organization, “notwithstanding that the organization serves persons having interests adverse to a client of the lawyer.” However, the lawyer may not participate in a decision or action of the organization if doing so creates a concurrent </span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One disturbing trend emerging in recent years is outside counsel guidelines (“OCGs”). Issued by major corporations, these guidelines restrict retained law firms’ activities, and they define conflicts of interest far more broadly than the “official” definitions in the Rules. For example, Wal-Mart’s OCG states that the company “expects a strong degree of loyalty from its Outside Counsel,” and that “Wal-Mart may conclude that an actual conflict of interest exists if Outside Counsel or Outside Counsel’s law firm represents a significant competitor of Wal-Mart or its subsidiaries or affiliates.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1115" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1115" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> This definition of “actual conflict of interest” contrasts sharply with Comment 6 to Rule 1.7, which explains that “simultaneous representation in unrelated matters of clients whose interests are only economically adverse, such as representation of competing economic enterprises in unrelated litigation, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page489" class="pagebreak" title="489">489</span>does not ordinarily constitute a conflict of interest and thus may not require consent of the respective clients.” </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Wal-Mart also requires outside counsel to alert the company of “potential conflicts of a philosophical or policy-driven nature that may compromise a position taken by the Company,” where a potential conflict is “a law firm’s representation of a client in a matter, though not actually adverse to Wal-Mart, [that] has the potential of becoming adverse.” Similarly, another company’s OCG warns:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Company has a broad array of business interests. It is important that you be sensitive both to direct conflicts of interest posed by your representation of Company and other clients and more indirect, issue or policy, conflicts that may arise from your firm’s advocacy on behalf of other clients of positions conflicting with Company business interests. We expect to be informed of and consulted with respect to all potential direct and indirect conflicts promptly.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1116" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1116" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Are these legitimate requests for information about the risk of emerging conflicts, or attempts by the companies to exert financial muscle in order to muzzle lawyers’ policy advocacy in unrelated matters that the company disapproves of?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Some commentators warn that OCGs that equate positional conflicts with any lawyer action that the company believes might ruffle its business interests threaten lawyer independence, and may make it hard for competitors to obtain legal services. One proposed remedy is an amendment to Rule 5.6(b), which prohibits lawyers from making agreements that would restrict their practice. (This Rule is treated in detail in Section G.3, <span style="font-style: italic;">infra.</span>)<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>The proposed amendment would prohibit a lawyer from offering or making “an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer’s right to practice is part of the terms of engagement of a lawyer by a client.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1118" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1118" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> Note that this amendment would not only prohibit law firms from accepting corporate clients under restrictive terms, but it would also prohibit inside counsel from requiring compliance with restrictive OCGs. Would this work?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Not all OCGs concern business conflicts. Wal-Mart’s OCG includes this directive: “Wal-Mart is deeply committed to diversity, both internally and in its Outside Counsel hiring practices. . . . We expect Outside Counsel to make <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page490" class="pagebreak" title="490">490</span>a good faith effort to recruit, retain, and promote qualified women and minorities.” A Mexican-American relationship partner at one of Wal-Mart’s largest outside law firms describes Wal-Mart’s diversity efforts as “a giant leap for all lawyers of color.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1119" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1119" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> Are directives to law firms about their hiring practices different in principle from directives about business conflicts?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Nearly lost amid its head-spinning twists and turns, the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election revealed potentially thorny positional conflicts for the prestigious law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Skadden had been retained by the Government of Ukraine (GoU) to produce a supposedly independent report (released in 2012) on the prosecution and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, allegedly for abuse of power and corruption. Tymoshenko had been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, and both the United States and the European Union condemned Tymoshenko’s imprisonment as a politically motivated persecution of Yanukovych’s political enemy. The pro-Russian Yanukovych government was a client of U.S. political operative Paul Manafort, who proposed that the GoU retain Skadden to write the report in an effort to burnish the GoU’s image. The Skadden report defended the legitimacy of the Tymoshenko prosecution, stating that the evidence supported conviction and that there had been no due process violations. The report was used by Ukrainian lobbyists, led by Manafort, in a public relations campaign to generate U.S. support for Yanukovych and undermine Tymoshenko. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What was not known at the time, but came out when Manafort pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy in relation to his Ukraine lobbying, was that a Skadden partner working on the report knew information that undermined the report. In November 2012, as Manafort was preparing to deploy the report, that Skadden partner told him privately (in his own name rather than that of the firm) that the evidence of Tymoshenko’s criminal intent was “virtually non-existent”—and that it was unclear that Tymoshenko had done anything her predecessors had not also done.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1120" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1120" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Neither of those observations appeared in the report. Next, the firm also agreed to work with the GoU’s prosecutors in a new prosecution of Tymoshenko on additional charges—“Project 2.” The firm lawyers working on Project 2 included some of the same lawyers involved in preparing the Report.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1121" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1121" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Did Skadden have a positional conflict of interest here? More specifically, was Skadden’s production of a supposedly objective report “materially limited” by its engagement by the GoU in connection with the second Tymoshenko prosecution—and, of course, by its knowledge that Manafort and the GoU wanted the report to favor the GoU?<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1122" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> A Skadden <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page491" class="pagebreak" title="491">491</span>partner wrote to Manafort in August 2012, “I am concerned that [the Law Firm’s] activity in Project 2 might surface before the Report comes out, and that would do enormous damage to the credibility of [the Report].”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1123" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1123" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Could the firm exercise independent legal judgment in writing the report while also receiving payment from the Ukraine and others to help prosecute a second case against Tymoshenko? The engagement agreement between Skadden and the GoU for writing the report stated that firm “will be free to reach its own conclusions based on its own independent work.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1124" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> And yet, Skadden received only $12,000 from the GoU for 950 hours work ($12.60 an hour), with the balance of its fees paid by a certain unnamed “Business Person-1,” an arrangement that calls into question how independent the report was.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1125" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1125" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> Furthermore, “certain Law Firm attorneys worked with Manafort to identify a public relations firm to assist the GoU with developing a public relations strategy centered on the Report.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1126" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1126" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The matter did not end well for the law firm. In the wake of the Mueller investigation, Skadden paid $4.6 million in Ukraine-related legal fees to the U.S. Treasury to settle a DOJ complaint that it had acted as an unregistered lobbyist for the Ukrainian government.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1127" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1127" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span> In the DOJ settlement agreement, Skadden admitted that “false or misleading oral or written statements [were] made by a former Partner of the Law Firm on the Law Firm’s behalf.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1128" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1128" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> The report’s lead author, partner Gregory Craig, resigned from Skadden.

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The law firm of Barnes &amp; Chippe employs over 400 lawyers in its New York office. The following situations have arisen within the last six months.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Barnes &amp; Chippe, which represents major chemical and real estate development corporations, has instituted a policy against firm lawyers sitting on boards of public interest environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, or providing pro bono assistance to those groups. In an intraoffice memorandum, the management committee explained that such memberships would create conflicts of interest because of the potential misuse of client confidences about controversial environmental decisions. The memorandum mentions that the policy evolved from a request by one of the firm’s most important clients.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A senior associate at Barnes &amp; Chippe has done pro bono work for several anti-abortion groups, including authoring an amicus brief for </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page492" class="pagebreak" title="492">492</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">a right-to-life organization in a Supreme Court case. A new partner in the firm, who sometimes works with this senior associate, has different views on reproductive rights. She offers her services to a reproductive rights advocacy organization to provide pro bono assistance on cases challenging abortion restrictions. A managing attorney in that organization thanks her for the offer, but indicates that the organization does not collaborate with lawyers in reproductive rights work when other members of their firm have represented right-to-life organizations. The organization wishes to avoid conflicts of interest and confidentiality concerns. The partner subsequently proposes that the firm establish a committee to screen pro bono cases and to put “controversial” issues to a firm vote before a lawyer undertakes representation.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Barnes &amp; Chippe has an active mergers and acquisitions department. In one case, Barnes &amp; Chippe represents corporation P in its hostile takeover attempt to win control of corporation Q. Corporation Q has adopted “poison-pill” bylaws that would make the takeover impossible, and Barnes &amp; Chippe is arguing before the Delaware Chancery Court that Q’s bylaws are illegal and contrary to public policy. At the same time, Barnes &amp; Chippe is defending corporation X against a takeover attempt by corporation Y. X has poison-pill bylaws very similar to those of corporation Q. In this case, a different team of Barnes &amp; Chippe lawyers is arguing before the same Delaware court that X’s poison-pill measures are perfectly legal. There is no connection between X, Y, P, and Q.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Barnes &amp; Chippe represents a small biotechnology company in its challenge to a federal regulatory decision. That decision prevents the company from marketing a new product, a genetically-engineered micro-organism that “eats” oil slicks, breaking them down into environmentally harmless components. Ecoclean, one of Barnes &amp; Chippe’s regular clients, is an environmental disaster-control firm that derives much of its income from cleaning up oil spills by conventional methods. Ecoclean protests to Barnes &amp; Chippe that if the biotechnology company succeeds in bringing its product to market, Ecoclean may lose millions of dollars, and perhaps may even be put out of business. Ecoclean’s general counsel sees a conflict of interest in the representation and threatens to take the company’s legal work elsewhere.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Family and trust and estates l</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">awyers often represent multiple clients in the same matter when their interests are not adverse. For example, a couple may retain a lawyer to assist with the adoption of a child, or a couple may go to a lawyer to draw up their will. In such cases, the clients’ interests usually align and it would be unreasonable and often impractical to require each family member to retain separate counsel. Notice that under Rule 1.7(a)(2) there is no concurrent conflict of interest if the risk of conflicting interests that would hamper legal representation is not “significant.” Lawyers must analyze those risks before undertaking joint representation.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet even the most innocuous multiple representation poses a potential conflict of interest if the parties’ interests fall out of alignment. Consider the Case of the Unwanted Will, described by Thomas Shaffer in the following excerpt.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Most of what American lawyers and law teachers call legal ethics is not ethics. Most of what is called legal ethics is similar to rules made by administrative agencies. It is regulatory. Its appeal is not to conscience, but to sanction. It seeks mandate rather than insight. I argue here that what remains and appropriately is called ethics has been distorted by the weaker side of an old issue in academic moral philosophy. This “weaker side” rests on two doctrines: first, that fact and value are separate; and second, that the moral agent acts alone; as W.H. Auden put it, each of us is alone on a moral planet tamed by terror. The influence of this philosophical position deprives legal ethics of truthfulness and of depth. . . .</span>

      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Ethical Context</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Ethics properly defined is thinking about morals. It is an intellectual activity and an appropriate academic discipline, but it is valid only to the extent that it truthfully describes what is going on. Those in contemporary ethics who concentrate on the importance of the truthful account argue first that fact and value are not separate—that stating the facts is, as Iris Murdoch put it, a moral act, a moral skill, and a moral art; and second, that organic communities of persons are prior in life and </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page494" class="pagebreak" title="494">494</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">in culture to individuals—in other words, that the moral agent is not alone. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the practice of estate planning, for example, the facts that are available for moral description are death and property: property seen in the context of mortality, death seen in the context of owning things. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What reconciles death with the ownership of property is the family. The family is the lens through which we understand death as the death of an owner, and property as something owned by dead people. The family is the cracked magnifying glass that shows how things broken by discord and death are whole. The family is normally why people bother with estate planning—“normally” in the sense that, but for the family, estate planning would not be a legal subject. The family is the cultural focus for the realization that estate planning is a worthwhile thing for people to do, because it reflects the hope that none of us will die alone. The human fact that is prior to the moral agency of which moral philosophy usually speaks is the family; the moral art of description in the legal ethics of estate planning is the skill to describe a family. . . .</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">II.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Case of the Unwanted Will</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I use, in teaching legal ethics, a series of quandaries that were posed in the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">American Bar Association Journal</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> in 1979. One of these quandaries describes John and Mary, a middle-aged couple with adult children. John and Mary want their wills drafted before beginning a vacation trip abroad. Based on John’s instructions, the lawyer prepares a set of parallel wills, each leaving all property to the surviving spouse, or, if both are dead, to their children in equal shares. On a second visit to the law office, the lawyer presents the prepared wills to the couple, and John executes his:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[T]he lawyer [then] suggests to John that he would like to be alone with Mary before she signs. John withdraws to another office. The lawyer asks Mary if the will is as she would have made it had her husband not been present at the conference and if the will were to be secret from her husband. She says no, that the will as drawn contains several provisions that are contrary to her wishes, and that she would change if her husband were not to know the ultimate disposition of her estate. However, she says that she would not be willing to precipitate the domestic discord and confrontation that would occur if her husband were to learn that she had drawn a will contrary to his wishes and in accordance with her own desires.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1129" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1129" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">You could say that the problem never would have arisen had the lawyer not talked to Mary alone. That description trivializes the problem, but many law students pose the quandary and the solution in just those terms. From their viewpoint, . . . [the problem is best analyzed in four steps]. First, a lawyer’s proper employment is by or for an individual. </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page495" class="pagebreak" title="495">495</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Second, employment by or for more than one individual is exceptional. Third, as a consequence, multiple party employment is necessarily superficial. Finally, the means for protecting the superficiality (or, if you like, the means for protecting the principle that employment is ordinarily and properly by or for individuals) is ignorance of any facts known to one of the individuals but not to the other.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It follows from this typical analysis that the lawyer’s moral mistake was in talking to Mary alone. Otherwise, Mary’s secret intention never would have come to his attention; her thoughts would be hidden, and that is appropriate because John’s thoughts are hidden. Now that the lawyer </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">has</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> talked to Mary alone, he is in an impossible situation: he cannot allow John to board the plane with the mistaken belief that Mary agreed with what “they” had decided. Nor, for the same reason, can he help Mary to make a different will. And, of course, he cannot allow Mary to execute a will that does not do what she wants it to do.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This principled analysis of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Case of the Unwanted Will</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> fails because of what is prior to analysis: the moral art of description. The failure is sad and, I think, corrupting. It is corrupting, first, because it rests on an untruthful account of what is going on. What is present in the law office is a family, and this one-lawyer-for-each-person way of first seeing a moral quandary in this situation and then resolving the quandary with the ethics of autonomy (the ethics of aloneness) leaves the family out of the account. The analysis looks on Mary as a collection of interests and rights that begin and end in radical individuality. Her affiliation with her husband, and with the children they have made and reared, is seen as a product of individuality(!), of contract and consent, of promises and the keeping of promises—all the consensual connections that lonely individuals use when they want circumstantial harmony. The employment of the lawyer is a result, then, of the links, the promises, the contract, the consent, and the need for circumstantial harmony. The family in the office is there only as the product of promise and consent. It is relevant to the legal business at hand only because the (radical) individuals, each in momentary and circumstantial harmony with one another, want it to be. The promise and the consent create the family.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This description is offered by the legal ethics of radical individualism. It is sad, corrupting, and untruthful. An alternative argument is that the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">family</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> created the promises, the contract, the consent, and the circumstantial harmony—not the other way around. The family is not the harmony; it is where the harmony (and disharmony) comes from. A truthful description of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Case of the Unwanted Will</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> is that the lawyer’s employer is a family. I suspect that that proposition will sound unusual in legal ethics, but my argument would be ordinary in other contexts. It treats, sees, and describes the family the way families are treated, seen, and described in the stories we tell, in the television commercials we watch, in the comics, and in our religious tradition. . . .</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Case of the Unwanted Will,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> for example, did not err in turning his attention to Mary, in John’s absence. (Nor would it have been a mistake to turn his attention to John, in Mary’s absence; if evenhandedness is important, it would have been more evenhanded to talk privately with each of them.) The deep things to be found out about John and Mary, in particular the deep things involved in their will making, are family things. Inquiring into deep family things is not only tolerated, but it is required by common representation, because </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">the client is the family.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Any other description is incomplete and, thus, untruthful and corrupting. If an adequate account of what is going on in the family (to the extent that it has to do with their will making) requires talking to either or both parents alone, then talking to them alone is appropriate. If the family is well represented, it (that is, each person in it) will learn how to take Mary’s purposes into account, because Mary is in the family.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> some further facts about Mary’s purposes. One of the couple’s sons, Henry, was married for ten years to, and is now divorced from, a woman named Susan. Henry and Susan had children who now live with Susan, and Henry lives alone. John and Mary, however, remain fond of Susan and, despite the divorce, continue to be friendly with her. The lawyer’s questions to John and Mary have brought this affection to the surface, but John, as is typical, thinks of property and family together, and Susan no longer is in the family. During the joint interview, Mary sits silent while John says that they want “Henry’s share” to go to Henry and, if Henry is dead, to his children. In the cases of the other children of John and Mary, says John, the child’s share is to go to the child’s spouse. What Mary says to the lawyer when they are alone, however, is that she wants her will to provide for Susan. Mary wants some of her family’s property to be available for Susan, after Mary dies, when what is left of Mary will be in her family. Mary will be there, not because of a fictional notion about ownership, but because Mary did not die alone.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It is interesting to note how the narrative force of that statement about Mary’s property changes as the case is described differently. Does Mary dispose of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">her</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> property, </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">her family’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> property, </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">her husband’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> property, or </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">her children’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> property? The point is that seeing and saying are moral and legal acts, and moral and legal arts. The law is a language; legal authority will support any one of these ways of speaking of this property, and any of the statements is a moral judgment, as, indeed, the word “property” is a moral judgment. . . .</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The first thing to observe about Shaffer’s analysis is that his critique focuses on the morality underlying conflicts doctrine, rather than the Rules. Shaffer criticizes the law of lawyering for excessive individualism, which ignores the many contexts in which we do not think of ourselves as individuals, but as members of a cohesive group like a family. In Shaffer’s view, to reduce a family to a collection of individuals simply misdescribes what families are, or at least how many families view themselves. Do you agree?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In analyzing the Case of the Unwanted Will, Shaffer writes that, from an individualist point of view:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Now that the lawyer </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">has</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> talked to Mary alone, he is in an impossible situation: he cannot allow John to board the plane with the mistaken belief that Mary agreed with what ‘they’ decided. Nor, for the same reason, can he help Mary to make a different will. And, of course, he cannot allow Mary to execute a will that does not do what she wants it to do.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Do you agree with these three judgments about the lawyer’s obligations? What is their basis in the Rules? What recommendation should the lawyer make to Mary?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> he disclose information that Mary requests him to keep confidential? What if John asks him directly about the conversation with Mary?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">If Mary requests that their conversation be kept confidential, </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">must</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the lawyer withdraw from the representation? </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">May</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the lawyer withdraw, given that withdrawal is certain to alert John that something unexpected has arisen in the lawyer’s conversation with Mary?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to Shaffer:</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Inquiring into deep family things is not only tolerated, but it is required by common representation, because </span>

Mary reveals to the lawyer that, as an unmarried teenager, before she met John, she gave birth to a baby girl, who was subsequently adopted by acquaintances of her parents. She tells the lawyer that she would very much have liked to make a bequest to her daughter. John does not know of the daughter’s existence, and it seems likely both to Mary and to the lawyer that disclosure of this secret now would jeopardize their relationship. Would these facts affect your answers to part (a) or to the confidentiality issues raised in note 2? Would your answer </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> addresses a version of these messy situations through a pair of hypotheticals involving a husband and wife whose wills are being prepared by a lawyer, with each of them leaving most of their property to the other. In the first hypothetical, the husband informs the lawyer, outside of his wife’s presence, that he wants his will to provide for an illegitimate child conceived during an adulterous affair that his wife does not know about. He directs that the bequest be paid out of money his wife believes he plans to leave to a charity—and therefore the secret bequest would not harm her financial expectations or interests, because she would not be getting the money anyway. He does not want his wife to learn about the bequest, the affair, or the child; she would find the knowledge devastating.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The second hypothetical is the same as the first, except that the money left to the child “would significantly deplete Husband’s estate, to Wife’s material detriment and in frustration of the Spouses’ intended testamentary arrangements.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> concludes that in the first hypothetical it would be proper for the attorney to draft the husband’s will as he directs, without informing his wife. Do you agree?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the second hypothetical, assuming that the husband will not permit the lawyer to inform the wife, the lawyer must withdraw. The lawyer may, in that case, exercise discretion about what to tell the wife: (a) that the lawyer must withdraw for reasons that her husband will not permit the lawyer to reveal; or (b) that the lawyer must withdraw, and that because of information received from her husband she should revoke her recent will; or even (c) enough of the details the husband has told the lawyer that the wife can protect her own interests going forward.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> How do these options square with the confidentiality provisions in Rule 1.6?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In <a id="dabmci_89bf857aca764917b50a53a819d15915" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;A v. B&quot; \s &quot;A;O;6;dabmci_89bf857aca764917b50a53a819d15915_1;Ib11879c9372111d9abe5ec754599669c;;0;S;A v. B, 726 A.2d 924 (N.J. 1999)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">A v. B</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">, 726 A.2d 924 (N.J. 1999)</span>, a lawyer representing a husband and wife in drafting their wills learned from another source, after the wills were executed, that the husband had a child out of wedlock. The lawyer wrote to the husband suggesting that he inform his wife, because the terms of the will might allow some of her assets to go to that child if she died before her husband. If the husband failed to make the disclosure, the lawyer warned that he would disclose this sensitive information. The husband sued the lawyer to prevent the lawyer from making the disclosure.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the lawyer had discretion to contact the wife and disclose the existence, but not the name, of the husband’s child. The applicable rule, Rule 1.6, created an exception to confidentiality requirements where necessary to “rectify the consequences of a client’s criminal, illegal or fraudulent act.” In the court’s view, the husband’s failure to reveal the child was fraudulent. The court also noted that the parties had signed a conflict waiver which explained that </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page499" class="pagebreak" title="499">499</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">information provided by one spouse might be available to the other. In the court’s view, the “spirit” of the waiver supported the lawyer’s decision.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Shaffer places a high value on the family “living in truth.” Consider this response:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Mary’s considered judgment is that ‘living in untruth’ permits the family to function; she does not think that John can ‘handle’ full information. In any event, even if she underestimates John in this regard, she is reluctant to take the risk. It is presumptuous and irresponsible for the lawyer to encourage this family to discover whether (in Shaffer’s words) it is equal to the truth of what it is.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">How might Shaffer answer this argument? How would you?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Did the lawyer in Shaffer’s Case of the Unwanted Will err by failing to discuss the possibility of conflicts of interest with John and Mary at the beginning of the representation? The ABA Special Probate and Trust Division Study Committee on Professional Responsibility says no. Its recommendations provide that lawyers may presume that the couple is “unified in goals and interests until shown otherwise.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1133" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1133" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Under these recommendations, if parties subsequently disclose information that they do not want revealed to their spouses, lawyers’ obligations depend on whether or not these confidences are “adverse” to the other spouse’s property interests, as discussed in note 4. Do you agree with this approach? Why shouldn’t a lawyer be required to raise the issue of potential conflicts at the outset of representation?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What of family secrets, more generally? Many attorneys are reluctant to inquire too deeply into family matters because of the serious emotional and ethical problems that such inquiries may entail. Lawyers are not therapists. It may therefore be useful to consider the strategies of those who </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">are</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> trained family therapists. These practitioners often receive confidential disclosures from one or more family members: a spouse has had a secret extramarital affair; a child is adopted and doesn’t know it; a son at college is gay and is trying to keep one parent from finding out.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To avoid such difficulties, some therapists recommend a preventive approach. In practice, therapists point out, most such disclosures will not come out of the blue; they will come after a family member has requested a private meeting or has hinted that she has additional information to impart. Given such a cue, therapists should discuss with the individual, couple, or family the problems of special confidences and explore how they should handle the situation. During this discussion, therapists should make clear that if keeping secrets begins to undermine their ability to provide adequate assistance to another family member, they will insist on disclosure, or they </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page500" class="pagebreak" title="500">500</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">will have to terminate the professional relationship. Only after such a discussion can therapists agree to receive confidential information.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1134" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1134" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Would this approach work for lawyers? Families in therapy may be more emotionally fragile than many families who come to lawyers for estate planning assistance. Does this imply that lawyers may take more “responsibility for forcing the situation” than would be prudent for therapists? Or should lawyers be even more reluctant to exert pressure, since they generally lack the therapeutic training that may be necessary to cope with destructive consequences?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Professor Russell Pearce argues that it is inappropriately paternalistic for lawyers to impose some single model of the appropriate family on all clients. In his view, such an approach ignores important distinctions in client preferences and power relationships. Rather, Pearce suggests that attorneys should give clients the option of being treated as a marital unit or as individuals after informed discussion. If spouses choose to be treated as a unit, then the lawyer may not keep secrets from either party.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Corporate Practice</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Shareholder derivative suits against the corporation, as well as corporate officers and directors, raise issues about whether the same lawyer can represent both the corporation and various individual defendants. Consent to joint representation is obviously suspect, because the same corporate officers named as individual defendants (and accused of placing their own interests ahead of the corporation’s) will make the decision about whether the corporation “consents” to joint representation. For that reason, the preferred solution is separate representation unless the plaintiff’s complaint is patently frivolous, seeks only minor relief, or does not charge officers and directors with significant wrongdoing.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1136" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1136" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Analogous problems may arise in cases where a corporation facing potential criminal or civil liability employs counsel to represent both an organization and its employees who may be individually implicated. Such joint representation has the advantages of a unified position, but it also risks potential conflicts. In some cases, the best interest of the company may be a legal strategy that throws the employee under the bus, while in others, the employee’s interests may best be served by reaching an agreement with the plaintiff or prosecutor on terms that harm the company. Obviously, if those risks are evident at the outset of the representation, counsel cannot take on the joint representation, but the conflict may emerge only later in the course of representation. The risks </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page501" class="pagebreak" title="501">501</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">of joint representation tend to fall disproportionately on the employee, who generally is not paying the lawyer’s fee and is not in a position to provide further business. A company may prefer joint representation to “hug the employee close” in cases where it fears that the employee will accept a deal that harms the company, even as the company prepares to scapegoat the employee.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Accordingly, commentators have argued for reforms in code provisions and case law to provide more protection for employees in such circumstances, primarily through requirements of special disclosures and independent advice.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Concurrent representation is also widespread in other corporate contexts such as bankruptcy proceedings, where a lawyer who is particularly knowledgeable about the debtor may represent multiple creditors; and transactional planning, where investors and entrepreneurs may rely on a single lawyer to create a corporation or partnership.

Consider the situation of Eduardo Saverin, the original investor and a founding co-owner of Facebook, who was pushed out of the company after he signed a re-incorporation agreement that provided for future dilution of his shares. In a subsequent lawsuit, Saverin claimed that he signed the agreement under the erroneous assumption that co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, co-owner Sean Parker, and the venture capital firm driving the re-incorporation had also agreed to dilute their own shares. A history of Facebook, which includes interviews with Saverin, offers the following account:</span>

They define such a client as a “repetitive user” who has had a “reasonable opportunity to obtain the advice of independent counsel of its own choosing (including in-house counsel) or [who] has assets in excess of $25 million,” or who operates in five jurisdictions, or who is a governmental entity with power to consent to waivers of conflicts of interest.</span>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">These clients, such ethicists believe, should be allowed to consent to advance waiver of conflicts of interest, including those involving direct adversity, provided that their confidences and secrets are protected by effective screening measures.

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">without</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> consent if the matter is not substantially related to one for which the firm is currently engaged for the client, as long as the firm (i) holds no material confidential information of the client regarding the new matter, and (ii) provides effective measures to screen the lawyers working on the two matters from each other.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">: Constitutional Concerns</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the context of criminal defense, conflicts of interest when the same lawyer represents multiple defendants (“multiple representation”) can raise Fifth and Sixth Amendment issues of due process and effective assistance of counsel, respectively. In such cases, ethical and constitutional standards can sometimes diverge: a representation can violate ethics rules without necessarily being unconstitutional. Here, we set out the constitutional framework; in the following sub-section, we turn to the ethical framework.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The constitutional framework draws on a quartet of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. In </span>

Arkansas</span>, 435 U.S. 475 (1978), a public defender assigned to represent three codefendants charged with robbery and rape <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page503" class="pagebreak" title="503">503</span>protested to the trial judge that he could not effectively represent them all. All three wished to testify, and he would be unable to examine any of them without potentially undermining the defenses of the other two; nor, of course, could he cross-examine his own clients. The obdurate trial judge refused to appoint separate counsel for the three, or to conduct an inquiry into whether the conflict of interest was genuine. Here, the Supreme Court held that the refusal to appoint separate counsel itself violates the Sixth Amendment: “[W]henever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection, reversal is automatic,” regardless of whether counsel’s conduct of the case demonstrably harms a defendant. <a id="dabmci_afaf43313ea5442aae506535985ec480" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 488.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, 446 U.S. 335 (1980)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, three criminal defendants—Sullivan, Carchidi, and DiPasquale—were indicted for the first-degree murder of a labor official and his companion. Two lawyers, DiBona and Peruto, represented all three defendants. Neither Sullivan nor his lawyers objected to the multiple representation at any point. Sullivan went to trial first. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, consisting primarily of an eyewitness who saw the three defendants at the scene of the crime. The witness testified that shortly afterward he heard firecracker-like sounds, and was told by Carchidi to leave and say nothing. Sullivan’s defense rested without presenting any evidence. Sullivan was convicted, while his codefendants were later acquitted at separate trials.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Sullivan appealed, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyers represented conflicting interests. On appeal, lawyers DiBona and Peruto offered conflicting accounts of the decision to present no affirmative case. DiBona claimed he had encouraged Sullivan to testify, while Peruto recalled that he had not “want[ed] the defense to go on because I thought we would only be exposing the [defense] witnesses for the other two trials that were coming up.” </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Here, the Court held that the trial court’s failure to inquire into whether the multiple representation was improper did not violate Sullivan’s constitutional rights (although in federal cases, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure demand such an inquiry).</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Such a test is not only unduly harsh, but incurably speculative as well. The appropriate question under the Sixth Amendment is whether an actual, relevant conflict of interests existed during the proceedings. If it did, the conviction must be reversed. . . . An actual conflict of interests negates the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, a showing that an actual conflict adversely affected counsel’s performance is not only unnecessary, it is often an impossible task. As the Court emphasized in </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">[I]n a case of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil—it bears repeating—is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">refrain</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> from doing. . . . And to assess the impact of a conflict of interests on the attorney’s options, tactics, and decisions in plea negotiations would be virtually impossible. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Moreover, in many cases the effects of the conflict on the attorney’s performance will not be discernible from the record. It is plain to me, therefore, that in some instances the defendant will be able to show there was an actual, relevant conflict, but be unable to show that it changed his attorney’s conduct.</span>

The likelihood that Gomez-Barajas’s plea bargain would be refused was minimal, and the record showed that Wheat’s testimony had little bearing on Bravo’s case. Indeed, the Government had added Wheat to its witness list against Bravo only after Wheat attempted to retain Iredale; Marshall therefore suspected that doing so was “a maneuver to prevent Iredale from representing [Wheat] at trial.” Justice Marshall quoted the District Court’s acknowledgment that Iredale “did a fantastic job in that [Gomez-Barajas] trial.” </span>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">An important conclusion is that the constitutional standards governing conflicts of interest in criminal defense may be different, and less demanding, than the ethical standards. Under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Cuyler</span> standard, a defendant who does not object in a timely way to conflicted representation has not been denied the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel unless the conflict adversely affects the defense lawyer’s performance. Rule 1.7, by contrast, prohibits concurrent conflicts of interest without any requirement of actual adverse effects. That means that, under <span style="font-style: italic;">Cuyler</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>representation of multiple criminal defendants that would be unethical under the Rules is not necessarily unconstitutional. Moreover, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cuyler</span>’s standard places the burden of proof on the convicted defendant to show that the unethical representation adversely affected defense counsel’s performance.</p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Criminal Defense Practice: Ethical Issues</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As we have noted, multiple representation of criminal defendants in the same matter may be constitutional without necessarily being ethical. Let us look more closely at the ethical standard. Rule 1.7(a)(2) declares the representation to be a concurrent conflict of interest if “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to another client.” Applying this rule requires an evaluation of the risks and benefits of multiple representation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">There are clearly potential benefits to multiple representation by a single lawyer or team of lawyers. First, and most obviously, defendants save money. By pooling their resources, they may obtain the services of an attorney that they otherwise could never afford. In white-collar contexts, defendants’ corporate employer may be willing to subsidize a unified defense for several employees. Minimizing the number of defense lawyers makes it easier to coordinate defenses. Multiple representation also facilitates control of information and “stonewalling,” the tactic of using a common attorney to encourage a united stance of noncooperation by several defendants or targets of investigations—perhaps not a </span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;">What about the risks of multiple representation?

          <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;">the possibility that the lawyer will elect to assert only those defense theories that can be raised consistently for all the defendants, thereby “losing” defense theories that might succeed for one defendant at the risk of incriminating others;</span>

          <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;">the difficulty in advising defendants whether or not to testify because if only one takes the stand, the jury may draw adverse inferences from the others’ failure to do so;</span>

          <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;">the difficulty in handling government evidence that is more damaging for some defendants than others. Emphasizing that a piece of evidence does not inculpate one client may simply underscore the fact that it </span>

          <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.5pt;"> inculpate others, while failing to emphasize this difference may leave the inaccurate impression that the evidence incriminates all defendants.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Stonewalling can also be a risky proposition for defendants. If a collective defense works, all is well from the defendants’ point of view, but if it doesn’t, hindsight may show that an individual client would have been better off cooperating with the authorities.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Consider this fact-pattern described by Kenneth Mann: “[E]ach client holds inculpatory evidence against the other, and the government has just enough evidence to consider asking for an indictment against each, but not enough to dismiss the option of granting immunity to one client in order to get determinative evidence against the other.”</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In this classic “prisoners’ dilemma,” what advice should defense counsel give? A lawyer who proposes a stonewall defense is asking the clients to trust each other, even though each knows that the other has a strong incentive to cut a deal. Can a defendant trust someone who has such a powerful reason to violate that trust? Moreover, each defendant knows that the other knows about that reason. Each, therefore, has grounds to suspect that the other will undertake a “preemptive” deal, which motivates each to strike first. In the words of game theorist Thomas Schelling: “I had to shoot him in self-defense to stop him from shooting me in self-defense.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As a practical matter, the lawyer’s role in such contexts may well be to convince each defendant that the other is trustworthy. By breaking the spiral of mutual suspicion, the lawyer may be able to prevent deals that are less desirable than a united defense. But—the point bears repeating—this requires advising defendants to follow a course that is </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">not</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> individually rational, and which carries significant risks.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">All this is to say that it is far from obvious whether representation of multiple defendants by a single lawyer does or does not create a “significant risk” of concurrent conflicts. Geer, in the analysis described above, recommended a <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> rule forbidding the multiple representation of criminal defendants. This issue arose in a dramatic form in 2017, when the head of the Cook County (Illinois) public defender service—one of the nation’s largest, because Cook County includes Chicago—challenged the practice of multiple representation.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_pp_sp_438_761_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />On June 15, 2016, the circuit court of Cook County entered an order of adjudication of direct civil contempt against contemnor, Amy P. Campanelli, the [head] Cook County public defender, and sanctioned Campanelli $250 per day until she purged herself of direct civil contempt or was otherwise discharged by due process of law. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush"><a id="co_anchor_I3d877b118c4211e9bcbecbd3bfe30" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />BACKGROUND</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Defendant Salimah Cole was charged in a 16-count indictment with 6 counts of first degree murder, 2 counts of armed robbery with a firearm, 5 counts of aggravated kidnapping, 1 count of aggravated arson, and 2 counts of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. The charges stemmed from the September 30, 2015, shooting, robbery, and kidnapping of La Prentis Cudjo and the robbery and kidnapping of Charles Morgan. Ashley <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page509" class="pagebreak" title="509">509</span>Washington, Allen Whitehead, Zacchaeus Reed, Jr., Julian Morgan, and Brianna Sago were also charged in connection with those crimes. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the May 10, 2016, court date, Cole informed the trial court that she was not able to afford private counsel. The trial court stated that it would appoint the public defender to represent Cole. Contemnor Amy P. Campanelli, the public defender of Cook County, then asked the court not to appoint the office of the public defender to represent Cole. Campanelli asked for leave of court to file a notice of intent to refuse appointment and to ask for appointment of counsel other than the public defender. When asked to explain her motion, Campanelli stated that she actually was refusing the appointment. Campanelli informed the court that the public defender could not represent Cole because there was a conflict of interest due to the codefendants in the case. Campanelli explained that four of Cole’s five codefendants were charged with the exact same offenses as Cole. In addition, codefendants Reed and Whitehouse were also charged with intimidation of codefendant Washington, for threatening to harm Washington and her family if she worked with the police on the murder case. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The trial court then asked Campanelli to explain the direct conflict to the court. Campanelli clarified that there was a potential for conflict. Campanelli asserted that she did not have to wait until a conflict developed, nor could she divulge attorney-client privileged information in order to inform the court of those conflicts. After considering the matter, the trial court appointed the public defender of Cook County to represent Cole, over Campanelli’s objection. Campanelli asked the court to hold her in friendly contempt and to impose a nominal sanction so that she could seek appellate review of the court’s decision. The trial court took the request under advisement and asked Campanelli to put the basis for her refusal to represent Cole in writing.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Campanelli based her decision and actions on the prohibition of concurrent conflicts of interest in Illinois Rule 1.7. In addition, she argued that her conflict must be imputed to all lawyers in the public defender’s office, because the public defender is a single law firm whose attorneys are vicariously disqualified under Rule 1.10. She took the position that in all cases with multiple defendants, private counsel must be appointed; the public defender cannot ethically represent more than one.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In response to further questioning from the trial court, Campanelli stated that there were approximately 518 attorneys in the office of the Cook County public defender and that those 518 attorneys did not all share the same supervisors. With regard to the four other motions to withdraw that Campanelli had filed concerning Cole’s codefendants, Campanelli acknowledged that she had four separate attorneys from different divisions in her office representing those defendants. In addition, those assistant public defenders each had a different supervisor, but those supervisors might report to the same deputy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page510" class="pagebreak" title="510">510</span>director. Campanelli conceded that she has a multiple defender division for multiple offender cases but contended that she was in conflict even in those cases.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[The judge held her in civil contempt and imposed a $250 per day fine “until such time as Campanelli purged herself of direct civil contempt by accepting appointment as counsel for defendant Cole or until she was otherwise discharged by due process of law.”]</p>

Sullivan</span>, 446 U.S. 335 (1980), recognized, however, that since a possible conflict of interest inheres in almost every instance of multiple representation, a defendant who objects to multiple representation must have the opportunity to show that potential conflicts imperil his right to a fair trial. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B112043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Campanelli maintains that she did show that potential conflicts imperiled Cole’s right to a fair trial, so that the trial court erred in finding her in direct contempt of court. In making this argument, Campanelli contends that representation by the office of the Cook County public defender is tantamount to representation by a single attorney for purposes of conflict of interest analysis. Consequently, <a id="co_pp_sp_438_766_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_pp_sp_7902_333_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />before we address whether Campanelli established that potential conflicts imperiled Cole’s right to a fair trial, we first must address Campanelli’s claim that representation by the public defender constitutes representation by a single attorney. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In support of this argument, Campanelli points to <a id="dabmci_5b7b8d3aee7c4d44ba8501afae740d4b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 1.10 of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct of 2010. Rule 1.10(a) provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Comment 1 to Rule 1.10 explains:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">For purposes of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the term ‘firm’ denotes lawyers in a law partnership, professional corporation, sole proprietorship or other association authorized to practice law; or lawyers employed in a legal services organization or the legal department of a corporation or other organization. . . . . Whether two or more lawyers constitute a firm within this definition can depend on the specific facts. </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page511" class="pagebreak" title="511">511</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Campanelli argues that the office of the public defender is a “firm,” which means that its associated members—the assistant public defenders—may not represent clients with conflicting interests. In making this argument, Campanelli acknowledges that <a id="dabmci_0d1d3a99bbfd43e5a0f84544a42ef915" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Robinson, People v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;18;dabmci_0d1d3a99bbfd43e5a0f84544a42ef915_2;Ia370da63d38a11d99439b076ef9ec4de;;0;S;People v.

Robinson</span>, 402 N.E.2d 157 (Ill. 1979), held that a public defender’s office is not a firm. However, Campanelli maintains that <span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson</span> did not resolve the question of whether the office of the public defender is a firm within the definition of Rule 1.10 because the <a id="dabmci_2f29d363b9134072a32531167f35b18a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson</span> decision predated the drafting of the written rules of professional conduct in Illinois. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B122043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />It is well settled that when statutes are enacted after judicial opinions are published, it must be presumed that the legislature acted with knowledge of the prevailing case law. . . . [T]his court is guided by the same principles applicable to the construction of statutes when interpreting supreme court rules. Consequently, in enacting the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility, and later the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct and the 2010 amendments to those rules, we presume that the court was well aware of its own case law holding that the office of the public defender is not a law firm for purposes of conflict of interest. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B132043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Having found that the office of the public defender is not a “firm” for purposes of Rule 1.10, we next address Campanelli’s claim that Rule 1.7 bars the public defender from representing multiple defendants in a single prosecution. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Campanelli also points to comment 23 to Rule 1.7, which explains that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[S]imultaneous representation of parties whose interests in litigation may conflict, such as coplaintiffs or codefendants, is governed by paragraph (a)(2).<a id="co_pp_sp_438_769_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_pp_sp_7902_336_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /> A conflict may exist by reason of substantial discrepancy in the parties’ testimony, incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing party or the fact that there are substantially different possibilities of settlement of the claims or liabilities in question. Such conflicts can arise in criminal cases as well as civil. The potential for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants in a criminal case is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent more than one codefendant.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Campanelli argues that Rule 1.7<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.7&quot; " /> and comment 23 establish that conflicts are inevitable in cases of joint representation of codefendants. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">While Rule 1.7 and comment 23 warn of the risk of joint representation of codefendants, the rule and comment address the representation of multiple defendants by one attorney. The issue here, in contrast, is whether representation of codefendants by different assistant public defenders presents a conflict of interest. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The fact that the trial court appoints the office of public defender to represent an indigent defendant, rather than appointing specific <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page512" class="pagebreak" title="512">512</span>assistant public defenders, does not thereby transform the office of the public defender into a single entity for purposes of conflict of interest analysis. Similarly, the fact that the appointed public defender has supervisory authority over his or her assistant public defenders does not override an assistant public defender’s undivided loyalty to his client. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B152043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />While Campanelli has oversight of the approximately 518 assistant public defenders in her office, it is the assistant public defender appointed to represent a defendant who provides the legal services to that defendant. The assistant public defender’s loyalty to his office has not been deemed great enough to impute to him the conflicts of other assistant public defenders. . . . [T]he fact that Campanelli has supervisory authority over all the assistant public defenders in the office of the Cook County public defender is not sufficient grounds, in and of itself, to disqualify the entire office from representing codefendants. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Campanelli next argues that, in any event, the trial court abused its discretion in appointing her to represent Cole because she twice informed the court that a direct conflict of interest prevented her from zealously representing Cole. Campanelli points to her written submission to the court stating that there was a conflict in representing Cole with respect to her codefendants, but that “more detail cannot be given without violating the attorney-client privilege, which is the very thing the Public Defender is seeking to avoid via the appointment of counsel.” When she appeared in court on the issue, Campanelli again told the court she was in conflict and could not “divulge attorney-client privilege information that I have learned about the other five codefendants in this case in order to tell you what the conflicts in this case are.” Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Holloway</span>, Campanelli contends that it was enough to prove a conflict when she, as an officer of the <a id="co_pp_sp_438_771_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />court, represented that Cole would be prejudiced by her appointment. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B172043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Campanelli is correct that counsel cannot be ordered to divulge attorney-client privileged information. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Holloway</span> explained that its holding did not preclude a trial court from exploring the adequacy of the basis of defense counsel’s representations regarding a conflict of interest without improperly requiring disclosure of the confidential communications of the client. The trial court in this case never ordered Campanelli to divulge confidential communications in attempting to ascertain the basis for Campanelli’s refusal to accept the appointment to represent Cole.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Campanelli then argues that the trial court erred in asking her to explain the direct conflict regarding the representation of Cole to the court. At oral argument, counsel for Campanelli argued that Campanelli need only allege a conflict of interest, without more, in order to withdraw from representation. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_pp_sp_438_772_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_pp_sp_7902_339_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_anchor_B182043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_anchor_B192043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_anchor_B202043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A defendant raising a potential conflict between two public defenders need only present the gist of such a conflict. . . . However, bare allegations of a conflict are not enough, and in the absence of an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page513" class="pagebreak" title="513">513</span>evidentiary record of conflict, a conflict should not be created based on mere speculation. Relevant factors to consider include whether the two public defenders were trial partners in the defendant’s case; whether the public defenders were in hierarchical positions where one supervised or was supervised by the other; or whether the size, structure, and organization of the office in which they worked affected the closeness of any supervision. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Upon review, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s finding. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We note that even in her brief on appeal, Campanelli’s argument concerning her conflict centers on a remote potential for conflict. She argues that it is all but inevitable in a joint representation that a conflict of interest will arise and that conflicts are difficult to discern at the outset of criminal litigation. Campanelli also argues that waiting to appoint conflict-free counsel until a conflict reveals itself is wasteful and often prejudicial. In addition, Campanelli asserts that conflicts that do not exist at the outset of a representation may arise later in the case. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These “potential conflicts,” however, are the type that may exist in every case involving multiple representation of codefendants. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cuyler</span> recognized that “a possible conflict inheres in almost every instance of multiple representation.” Nonetheless, the United States Supreme Court and this court have declined to find a <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> conflict of interest simply because multiple representation may involve a conflict of interest. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="co_anchor_B212043282862_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="co_pp_sp_438_774_1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s judgment finding Campanelli to be in direct civil contempt and imposing sanctions for that contempt. We note, however, that the record is clear that the trial court understood Campanelli’s contempt was purely a formal one and that the motivation for the contempt was solely to permit an appeal of the issue of multiple representation of defendants in light of the 2010 revisions to the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct. Given these circumstances, we vacate the order of the trial court holding Campanelli in contempt and vacate the award of sanctions, despite our finding that the contempt order and award of sanctions were valid. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Circuit court judgment affirmed. Adjudication of direct civil contempt vacated.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Section D </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">infra</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> will discuss the issue of vicarious (or “imputed”) disqualification of all attorneys in a firm based on a single firm member’s conflict in greater detail. For present purposes, it suffices to know that under Rule 1.10, if one lawyer in a firm would be conflicted out of a multiple representation because of a concurrent conflict, all the lawyers in the firm are likewise disqualified, even if no lawyer in the firm would actually represent more than one of those clients. Comment 2 to Rule 1.10 explains that “a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page514" class="pagebreak" title="514">514</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">governing loyalty to the client,” and “each lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty owed by each lawyer with whom the lawyer is associated.” Thus, if Lawyer A in the firm represents Client 1, while Lawyer B in the same firm represents Client 2, it is as though one lawyer is representing both clients—and if either lawyer is disqualified for a concurrent conflict of interest, so are all the other lawyers in the firm. Campanelli’s argument is that these principles should apply to the public defender’s office, just as they do to a private law firm. </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rejecting her argument, the Illinois Supreme Court places weight on the fact that the Cook County Public Defender has more than 500 lawyers. Those who would represent Cole and her codefendants would each represent only one of them, and each lawyer would report to a different supervisor. The court concludes that, in real-world terms, each defendant’s lawyer would be able to offer undivided loyalty to their client. The conflict of interest is formal, but not real.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Wouldn’t the same argument apply to a large private law firm? For example, the home office of the Chicago-based law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis has more than 700 lawyers—and yet the vicarious disqualification rule unquestionably applies to private law firms like Kirkland.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The court cites a 1979 Illinois case, <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Robinson</span>, for the proposition that a public defender office is not a law firm for purposes of the vicarious disqualification rule. Why not? In <span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson</span>, the prosecution argued that public defender offices are structured differently from private law firms, and individual defenders do not owe the same duty of loyalty to their office that private attorneys owe to their firms, a loyalty that may conflict with undivided loyalty to clients. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson</span> court rejected both those explanations, however. Instead, it based its holding on a practical concern: “<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">[T]he application of such a </span><span style="font-style: italic; background-color: #FFFFFF;">per se</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> rule [of vicarious disqualification] would require the appointment of counsel with virtually no experience in the trial of criminal matters, thus raising, with justification, the question of competency of counsel.”</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1147" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Is this really so? The three cases consolidated in </span><span style="font-style: italic; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Robinson </span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">took place in relatively small counties, where it may indeed be supposed that the number of capable criminal defense lawyers in private practice is small.

Does </span><span style="font-style: italic; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Robinson</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">’s rationale apply in such circumstances?</span></p>

In so holding, the courts have acknowledged and given effect to several interrelated considerations. An “attorney representing two defendants in a criminal matter is in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when a conflict of interest exists or will probably develop in the course of a trial.” Second, defense attorneys have the obligation, upon discovering a conflict of interests, to advise the court at once of the problem.

      <p class="TextParagraph">

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">If lawyers were unable to accept new matters adverse to past as well as current clients, the rules would be unworkable. As attorneys’ careers progressed, and their number of past clients increased, their ability to accept new cases would plummet. Lawyers would become totally identified with their previous clients, and the concept of an independent profession would be threatened.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">For that reason, it is often said that the rules governing concurrent representation of conflicting interests are based on loyalty and confidentiality, while the rules governing successive representation are based on confidentiality alone.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1149" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1149" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> When confidentiality is not an issue, lawyers may represent current clients against former clients. The principal exception occurs when a lawyer, on behalf of the current client, attacks work done on behalf of a former client, for example by litigating to declare a contract unenforceable even though the lawyer drafted the contract in the earlier representation. Here, disqualification results whether or not the lawyer acquired confidences from the former client. The rationale for this exception is given in the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Restatement</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> § 132, cmt. (b): “[A]t the time the lawyer represented the former client, the lawyer should have no incentive to lay the basis for subsequent representation against that client, such as by drafting provisions in a contract that could later be construed against the former client.”</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To determine when representation adverse to a former client poses significant confidentiality concerns, courts and ethical codes have focused on whether there is a “substantial relationship” between the current and the former matter. The following case is a leading precedent on point. Although the court decides the case under the 1969 Code of Professional </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page517" class="pagebreak" title="517">517</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Responsibility, the doctrine remains materially the same under the Model Rules.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The case below arose out of Westinghouse’s antitrust suit against uranium suppliers, alleging that price-fixing by its suppliers forced Westinghouse to default on nuclear reactor contracts. Although Gulf Oil Corporation and United Nuclear Corporation (UNC) were both defendants in this action, their interests were adverse: UNC was trying to exculpate itself by inculpating Gulf. UNC was represented by the Bigbee law firm, which had previously represented Gulf. Gulf therefore moved for Bigbee’s disqualification.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In terms of Bigbee’s past services for Gulf, from 1971 through 1976, Bigbee had represented Gulf on legal matters concerning Gulf’s uranium operations in New Mexico. Gulf obtained uranium reserves at Mt. Taylor, and Bigbee drafted mining patents for that property and litigated conflicting claims to the property. Gulf alleged that it had given Bigbee detailed information about the quality and quantity of uranium at Mt. Taylor, together with information concerning Gulf’s reasons for delaying production of that uranium. Such information, Gulf argued, was directly relevant to Westinghouse’s allegation that Gulf had withheld uranium in restraint of trade. Accordingly, Gulf claimed that Bigbee’s access to confidential communications could aid UNC in its effort to inculpate Gulf. Unmoved, the district court denied Gulf’s motion to disqualify Bigbee. This appeal to the Seventh Circuit followed.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">In this case we review the propriety of a district court’s refusal to grant a motion to disqualify opposing counsel. The issues presented are whether there is a sufficient relationship between matters presented by the pending litigation and matters which the lawyers in question worked on in behalf of the party now seeking disqualification and whether the party seeking disqualification has given legally sufficient consent to the dual representation. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">II</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The district court set out and attempted to apply what is clearly settled as the relevant test in disqualification matters: where an attorney represents a party in a matter in which the adverse party is that attorney’s former client, the attorney will be disqualified if the subject matter of the two representations are “substantially related.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[T]he determination of whether there is a substantial relationship turns on the possibility, or appearance thereof, that confidential information might have been given to the attorney in relation to the subsequent matter in which disqualification is sought. The rule thus does </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page518" class="pagebreak" title="518">518</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">not necessarily involve any inquiry into the imponderables involved in the degree of relationship between the two matters but instead involves a realistic appraisal of the possibility that confidences had been disclosed in the one matter which will be harmful to the client in the other. The effect of the Canons is necessarily to restrict the inquiry to the possibility of disclosure; it is not appropriate for the court to inquire into whether actual confidences were disclosed.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Essentially then, disqualification questions require three levels of inquiry. Initially, the trial judge must make a factual reconstruction of the scope of the prior legal representation. Second, it must be determined whether it is reasonable to infer that the confidential information allegedly given would have been given to a lawyer representing a client in those matters. Finally, it must be determined whether that information is relevant to the issues raised in the litigation pending against the former client.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although the district court properly identified this rule of law, it erred in its application. . . . Here it could reasonably be said that during the former representation the attorneys might have acquired information related to the subject matter of the subsequent representation, that the former representation was lengthy and pervasive, that the former representation was more than peripheral, and that the relationship between the two matters is sufficiently close to bring the later representation within the prohibition of the canons. Therefore there was clearly a substantial relationship between the two representations.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Given the conclusion that the Bigbee firm’s prior work for Gulf was sufficiently related to issues raised in the present litigation, it is necessary to address UNC’s argument that Gulf waived any right it might have had to seek disqualification. Although this issue was not addressed by the district court, we hold that, even accepting completely UNC’s account of the facts supporting waiver, these facts are legally insufficient to demonstrate a waiver that would prevent disqualification in the present case.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">UNC now claims that in 1971, as Gulf began development of its New Mexico properties and sought to retain the Bigbee firm, Gulf was informed that the Bigbee firm had a prior relationship with UNC, which </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page519" class="pagebreak" title="519">519</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">like Gulf was involved in the mining of uranium. UNC further claims that Bigbee informed Gulf that due to this relationship the Bigbee firm could only represent Gulf if Gulf consented that should a conflict arise between Gulf and UNC, Bigbee would not be precluded from representing UNC. Although this forms the basis of UNC’s argument of waiver, it also argues that the waiver was subsequently reaffirmed by Gulf on two other occasions. . . . Ultimately UNC’s waiver argument depends on the underlying proposition that a client would, or even may, authorize an attorney to utilize against him information given to the attorney in confidence.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As we noted earlier, disqualification in this case is required by the application of Canon 4 [the confidentiality rule]. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[I]t is impossible to conclude that a client could ever have any reason to desire that information disclosed in confidence should be utilized against him. . . . Accordingly, we hold that a simple consent by a client to representation of an adverse party is not a defense to that former client’s motion for disqualification, such as the one under review here, based on the possibility that confidential information will be used against the former client.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> test: Matters are substantially related if there is “a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client’s position in the subsequent matter.” According to this test, not only must the confidential information that presumptively passed from the former client to the attorney be relevant to the present case, it must materially advance the present client’s position.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">But when, exactly, are two representations “substantially related”? It is not always easy to say what information about the former client is confidential and material to the new representation. Matters are clearly substantially related if the current matter involves the work the lawyer performed for the former client. But beyond that, determining whether two representations are “substantially related” gets murkier.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Consider the so-called “playbook problem.” As explained by Charles Wolfram: “Playbook involves the claim that although the lawyer doesn’t know anything specific about the matter, the lawyer knows a lot of generalities about the former client and therefore the lawyer is disqualified.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Wolfram elaborates: “There have been cases suggesting that if you know something about the way the client’s head works you know something that’s relevant for purposes of applying the substantial relationship test. . . .”</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A representative example of this “playbook problem” involves Wendy Fleishman, a lawyer who had previously represented the insurance company MetLife in personnel matters. Fleishman was disqualified when she joined a law firm representing MetLife employees suing the company for gender discrimination. The court concluded that she knew too much about MetLife’s personnel department and its procedures; furthermore, she “was privy to highly privileged communications originating with MetLife’s corporate law department regarding settlement strategies in class action litigations.” In other words, even if Fleishman knew nothing specific about the gender discrimination cases, she knew MetLife’s playbook, and that made her past cases and the present case “substantially related.” Interestingly, Professor Wolfram served as an expert witness on the side of Fleishman’s new firm, which opposed disqualification; in response, the judge cited the paragraph quoted above from his article to explain why she must be disqualified.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Assume, for example, that Lawyer for ten years represents Manufacturer defending product liability cases involving a particular product. Over that time Lawyer has become intimately familiar with Manufacturer’s engineers, in-house lawyers, the technology, whereabouts of files, Manufacturer’s attitudes regarding settlement, and the like. . . . Lawyer ceases the representation and returns all the files to Manufacturer. A year later a person injured while using that type of product seeks to hire Lawyer to sue Manufacturer. The injury occurred after Lawyer and Manufacturer parted ways.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Exactly how much information is required in order to trigger disqualification because the lawyer knows the former client’s “playbook”? Courts currently disagree, although the Rules seek to impart some clarity via Comment 3 to Rule 1.9. It states that “general knowledge of the client’s policies and practices ordinarily will not preclude a subsequent representation; on the other hand, knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a representation.” In the MetLife case, did Fleishman’s knowledge of MetLife’s settlement strategies for class actions count as “general knowledge of the client’s policies and practices,” or as “specific facts relevant to the matter in question”?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Notice that <span style="font-style: italic;">T.C. Theatre</span> refers to a substantial relationship between “the matters or cause of action,” which suggests that the relationship can exist between the <span style="font-style: italic;">facts</span> (“matters”) of the two cases or between the <span style="font-style: italic;">legal </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page522" class="pagebreak" title="522">522</span><span style="font-style: italic;">issues</span> (“cause of action”) of the two cases. Focusing on legal issues generally results in a considerably narrower range of disabling conflicts than focusing on factual questions. Thus, for example, a lawyer may represent a client in a series of real estate transactions and then attempt to represent the client’s spouse in a divorce action where the value of the former client’s property is a contested issue.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1157" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1157" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span> The legal questions are completely unrelated, but the factual questions overlap and the potential for misusing the former client’s confidences is significant. Thus, the two matters would be substantially related under Model Rule 1.9 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse v. Gulf</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What if a lawyer did not personally represent the former client, but the lawyer’s former firm did? Ordinarily, one lawyer’s conflicts of interest are imputed to all lawyers in the firm, but this imputation may end when the lawyer leaves the firm, provided the lawyer acquired no confidential information about the former client.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Under those circumstances, if the lawyer’s new firm seeks to represent a party against the previous firm’s former client, the new firm may rebut the presumption that the lawyer had obtained confidences. This exception is governed by Rules 1.9(b)–(c).</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">under Rule 1.10(a)(2), even if a lawyer who moves to a new firm has, in fact, acquired confidential information about a client of a former firm, the new firm may still represent a client whose interests conflict with the former firm client if proper screening devices are put into place. Furthermore, just as Rule 1.9(b) allows lawyers who have moved to a new firm to rebut the presumption that they acquired confidential information about the former firm’s client, Rule 1.10(b) allows the former firm to rebut the presumption that any of its lawyers retain confidential information about the former client after the lawyers who represented that client depart.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">You are a business lawyer with an expertise in corporate mergers and acquisitions. Executives from Insatiable Industries approach you to represent Insatiable in a forthcoming hostile takeover attempt of Tidbit Technologies. One of the crucial decisions in any hostile takeover is how much to offer stockholders of the target for their shares; the amount must be large enough to induce them to sell, but not so large that acquiring the target becomes unprofitable. To set the share price of the tender offer, corporate raiders carefully evaluate the profitability of the target, a task for which information about the target is crucial. Although normally such calculations are made by financial specialists well in advance of retaining counsel, adjustments in the face of new information are possible. Bearing this in mind, consider four alternative scenarios:</span>

A different law firm than yours handled Tidbit’s takeover defense, which included lawsuits in state and federal courts. However, after losing on a complex choice-of-law issue, Tidbit retained your firm to draft a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The cert petition was denied, and that ended the representation. No lawyer in your firm acquired confidential information from Tidbit.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

No lawyer in your firm acquired confidential information from Tidbit. However, if you represent Insatiable Industries in its takeover of Tidbit, you may be forced to argue in court that the poison pill provisions you drafted violate state law.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Mickens was sentenced to death for murdering Timothy Hall “during or following the commission of an attempted forcible sodomy,” a circumstance making him death-eligible. </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">. It was later discovered that Mickens’s counsel, Bryan Saunders, was Hall’s appointed counsel at the time of the murder in a juvenile-court assault and concealed weapons case. Saunders met Hall once, for about fifteen to thirty minutes. Just one business day after the state court judge discharged Saunders because of Hall’s death, she appointed Saunders to represent Mickens in Hall’s murder case. She did not conduct an inquiry into the possibility that Saunders had a conflict of interest. When the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Mickens’s habeas petition (which sought relief under the Sixth Amendment, for ineffective assistance of counsel), he appealed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> delivered the opinion of the Court.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The question presented in this case is what a defendant must show in order to demonstrate a Sixth Amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into a potential conflict of interest about which it knew or reasonably should have known. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">II</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to “the assistance of counsel for his defence.” This right has been accorded, we have said, “not for its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.” It follows from this that assistance which is ineffective in preserving fairness does not meet the constitutional mandate, see </span>
        <a id="dabmci_38c047e2170b4853be6a552850df74bd" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland v. Washington</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, 466 U.S. 668, 685–686 (1984)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">; and it also follows that defects in assistance that have no probable effect upon the trial’s outcome do not establish a constitutional violation. As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth Amendment violation must demonstrate “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">There is an exception to this general rule. We have spared the defendant the need of showing probable effect upon the outcome, and </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page525" class="pagebreak" title="525">525</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">have simply presumed such effect, where assistance of counsel has been denied entirely or during a critical stage of the proceeding. When that has occurred, the likelihood that the verdict is unreliable is so high that a case-by-case inquiry is unnecessary. But only in “circumstances of that magnitude” do we forgo individual inquiry into whether counsel’s inadequate performance undermined the reliability of the verdict.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">We have held in several cases that “circumstances of that magnitude” may also arise when the defendant’s attorney actively represented conflicting interests. The nub of the question before us is whether the principle established by these cases provides an exception to the general rule of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> under the circumstances of the present case. . . . </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Since this was not a case in which (as in </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Holloway</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">) counsel protested his inability simultaneously to represent multiple defendants; and since the trial court’s failure to make the [</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;"> Sullivan</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">-mandated inquiry does not reduce the petitioner’s burden of proof; it was at least necessary, to void the conviction, for petitioner to establish that the conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel’s performance. The Court of Appeals having found no such effect, the denial of habeas relief must be affirmed.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Lest today’s holding be misconstrued, we note that the only question presented was the effect of a trial court’s failure to inquire into a potential conflict upon the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Sullivan</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> rule that deficient performance of counsel must be shown. The case was presented and argued on the assumption that (absent some exception for failure to inquire) </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Sullivan</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> would be applicable—requiring a showing of defective performance, but </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">not </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">requiring in addition (as </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> does in other ineffectiveness-of-counsel cases) a showing of probable effect upon the outcome of trial. . . . Both </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Sullivan </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">itself and </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Holloway </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">stressed the high probability of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice. Not all attorney conflicts present comparable difficulties. Thus, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure treat concurrent representation and prior representation differently, requiring a trial court to inquire into the likelihood of conflict whenever jointly charged defendants are represented by a single attorney (Rule 44(c)), but not when counsel previously represented another defendant in a substantially related matter, even where the trial court is aware of the prior representation.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This is not to suggest that one ethical duty is more or less important than another. The purpose of our </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> itself is evidently inadequate to assure vindication of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. . . . In resolving this case on the grounds on which it was presented to us, we do not rule upon </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> should be extended to such cases remains, as far as the jurisprudence of this Court is concerned, an open question.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Mickens</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> in three separate opinions (and Justice Kennedy concurred separately as well). Justice Stevens argued that Saunders’s prior representation of Hall may indeed have adversely affected his performance:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Mickens’ habeas counsel garnered evidence suggesting that Hall was a male prostitute; that the area where Hall was killed was known for prostitution; and that there was no evidence that Hall was forced to the secluded area where he was ultimately murdered. An unconflicted attorney could have put forward a defense tending to show that Mickens killed Hall only after the two engaged in consensual sex, but Saunders offered no such defense. This was a crucial omission—a finding of forcible sodomy was an absolute prerequisite to Mickens’ eligibility for the death penalty.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Justice Stevens also noted that Saunders’s duty to keep Hall’s confidence did not end with Hall’s death, and in this case, Saunders did not disclose that Hall’s mother had sworn out a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery—a disclosure which might have allowed Mickens to challenge her victim-impact statement that “all [she] lived for was that boy.” </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Mickens</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">: the peculiarity of having a murder victim’s attorney represent his alleged murderer, the state’s role in creating this anomalous situation by appointing the victim’s attorney to represent his murderer, and the fact that the death penalty hung in the balance.

        <span style="color: #000000;">On a less substantive note, it is striking that none of the nine justices or their clerks appeared to know that the rules of professional conduct are not called the “Canons of Legal Ethics.” The ABA Code replaced the Canons of Professional Ethics in 1969, thirty-three years before </span>

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The State asserted in its brief that Mickens’s argument of inadequate assistance of counsel “relies heavily on the immediate visceral impact of learning that a lawyer previously represented the victim of his current client.” Is visceral impact all there is to it? Should the fact that a trial feels fundamentally unfair count for purposes of establishing constitutional standards?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In dicta at the end of its opinion, the Court’s majority insists that it has not addressed the general question of whether a former-client conflict adversely affecting counsel’s performance is </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">per se</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> a constitutional error. To the contrary, the Court merely assumed that it is for purposes of inquiring about “the effect of a trial court’s failure to inquire into a potential conflict upon the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Sullivan</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> rule.” </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">. The majority goes on to suggest that, in former-client conflicts, perhaps the rule should be the less defendant-friendly </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Strickland</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> standard, which requires the defendant to show prejudice. Would that be an appropriate rule?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Lawyers and law firms nervous about conflicts of interest frequently ask clients to waive potential conflicts in advance. Waivers can encompass both concurrent and former-client conflicts. Recall that the validity of such a waiver came up in </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Westinghouse v. Gulf Oil</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, where UNC argued that Gulf Oil had waived the right to disqualify the Bigbee firm. The court disagreed. Under the Seventh Circuit’s analysis, client waivers may be binding in cases of concurrent representation because clients are in an “adequate position to judge the effects of divided loyalties.” By contrast, in cases of successive representation:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Disqualification based on the potential for abuse of confidential information . . . involves different considerations which preclude the effectiveness of consent, particularly a vague, general consent given or implied prior to the threat of disclosure or adverse litigation. In that instance it is impossible to conclude that a client could ever have any reasons to desire that information disclosed in confidence should be utilized against him.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet as other courts and commentators have noted, waivers consisting of “a vague, general consent given or implied prior to the threat of disclosure or adverse litigation” may be equally suspect in concurrent representation. In the words of the </span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Various cognitive biases prevent individuals from adequately comprehending information, even when conflicts are fully disclosed. Because so much self-serving bias operates at unconscious levels, neither those who give, nor those who receive, skewed advice may appreciate the extent of the problem. A further problem is that informed consent strategies may reduce professionals’ feelings of concern about potentially adverse effects, and encourage them to merely disclose, rather than avoid, compromising influences.</span>

Boies signed a contract on Weinstein’s behalf with the Black Cube private investigation organization that directed it to uncover “intelligence which will help the client’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY Newspaper.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1168" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1168" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> The newspaper was the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>, which Boies’s firm, <a id="OLE_LINK39" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="OLE_LINK40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, was representing in unrelated matters. When the Boies-Black Cube contract surfaced, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times’s</span> lawyers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page530" class="pagebreak" title="530">530</span>denounced Boies’s conduct as a “grave betrayal of trust” and terminated the firm.<a id="_Ref33382772" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1169" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1169" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Boies, however, denied that efforts to discredit the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> story reflected such a conflict. In his view, it was “entirely appropriate to investigate precisely what [Weinstein] was accused of doing and to investigate whether there were facts that would rebut those accusations.” He added: “If evidence could be uncovered to convince the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> the charges should not be published, <a id="OLE_LINK41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="OLE_LINK42" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />I did not believe, and do not believe, that that would be adverse to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times’s</span> interests.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1170" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1170" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> Boies also pointed out that his firm had a clause in its retainer agreement with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> that purported to waive all conflicts of interest on matters unrelated to the matter on which the newspaper had retained the firm.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1171" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> Specifically, a clause in the retainer agreement stated that the firm might engage with clients “where the interests of the other persons, and the Firm’s representation of them, may be against the [<span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>’<span style="font-style: italic;">s</span> interests], including adversity in litigation.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1172" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">We never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters. Such an operation is reprehensible, and the Boies firm must have known that its existence would have been material to our decision whether to continue using the firm.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The “legalistic argument” that could be made on behalf of Boies and Boies Schiller rests on a 2006 ethics opinion, where the Association of the Bar of the City of New York took the position that, if a client is sophisticated, “blanket or open-ended advance waivers that are accompanied by relatively limited disclosure about the prospective conflicting matters should nevertheless be enforceable.” That is because “[s]ophisticated clients need less disclosure.” Indeed, “a law firm may ethically request an advance waiver that includes substantially related matters” if the client is sophisticated, provided the following conditions are met: “the waiver is not applied to opposite sides of the same litigation and opposite sides in a starkly disputed transactional matter”; client confidentiality is not compromised; the conflict is “consentable” under the ethics rules; and one other condition not relevant to the Boies-Weinstein matter.<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1174" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1174" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span> A consentable multiple representation is one in which “a disinterested lawyer would believe that the lawyer can competently represent the interest of each [client].” This test comes from an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page531" class="pagebreak" title="531">531</span>earlier version of the New York ethics rules; the current version of <a id="dabmci_d64add1926df4a619a770d4ef5296daf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />New York Rule 1.7(b) is identical in wording to the Model Rule. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What is your view? Did the firm’s expansive advance waiver (contained in the Boies Shiller-<span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> retention agreement) comply with Model Rule 1.7 and cure any potential violation?

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Games Lawyers and Clients Play: “Sabotage,” “Protection,” and “Hot Potatoes”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One reason law firms seek advance waivers is to ward off strategic behavior by business clients to “conflict them out” of adverse representations. Sophisticated corporate clients, that is, sometimes distribute small amounts of legal work among many law firms in order to ensure that they will be unavailable to represent potential adversaries in upcoming major deals or litigation—a tactic that some lawyers describe as “sabotage.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1177" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1177" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> This is one of several conflict-of-interest games that shrewd businesses and law firms play with each other. A related practice is to place highly feared lawyers on retainer so that they cannot represent future opponents. Prominent lawyers may, in turn, exploit their reputations to extract generous nonrefundable retainers from cautious corporations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A well-publicized example involved Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. For many years, named partner Joseph Flom was among the premier mergers-and-acquisitions lawyers in New York City, and at one point nearly 300 corporations were paying $150,000 annual retainers to Skadden Arps for the purpose of “sterilizing Joe”: that is, ensuring that Flom would not end up representing the enemy in a takeover battle. Retainers during this period sometimes accounted for more than 40 percent of Skadden’s income.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1178" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1178" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Although critics charged that the retainers were little more than protection money, Skadden justified its practice as a safeguard against sabotage. In Flom’s words, “If you didn’t have some way of assuring a guy was serious about hiring you, everybody would talk to you about some tiny problem and you’d be conflicted out of </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page532" class="pagebreak" title="532">532</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">everything.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Skadden nevertheless came under fire for its policy of declining legitimate (not “sabotage”) matters in order to escape being conflicted out of more lucrative work later. To address these difficulties, the firm made a short-lived effort to “have its cake and eat it too” by accepting non-refundable retainers from clients but also asking them to waive conflicts of interest. This would permit Skadden to drop their matter, represent an adversary, and keep the money. In the face of public criticism, Skadden announced that it would change its practice and refund the year’s retainer if it invoked the waiver clause against a client. Skadden also encouraged retainer clients to utilize the firm rather than merely buying its inactivity.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Matters stand differently, however, in scenarios in which a lawyer withdraws from an active case in order to represent the adversary in a more profitable matter. Rule 1.16(b) permits withdrawal if it “can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client.” Yet courts have consistently forbidden withdrawal for purposes of representing the client’s adversary.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Review the hypothetical involving Tidbit Technologies and Insatiable Industries in Problem 2 above.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At the time Insatiable Industries approaches you about the Tidbit takeover, your firm is representing Tidbit in a minor piece of trademark-infringement litigation against a snack food company with a similar name. The litigation is expected to generate less than $100,000 in fees, while the Insatiable Industries takeover would bring in millions. May your firm withdraw from the trademark case in order to represent Insatiable? The trademark case is at an early enough stage that withdrawal would not obviously affect trial preparation or expense.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You suspect that Tidbit Technologies retained your firm for the trademark litigation only because it anticipated a hostile takeover attempt, and wanted to create a conflict that would prevent your firm </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">from representing potential corporate raiders. In effect, Tidbit’s savvy general counsel appears to have “planted” the trademark case in order to neutralize you. May that affect your decision whether to withdraw?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When Tidbit Technologies engaged your firm for the trademark case, the retainer agreement included a clause in which Tidbit waived any conflicts of interest with “existing or new clients in any matter that is not substantially related to our work for you even if the interests of such clients in those other matters are directly adverse.” Does this permit you to represent Insatiable Industries in its attempt to take Tidbit over?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">when a lawyer is disqualified from a representation because of a conflict, the disqualification is typically imputed to the lawyer’s entire law firm.

        <span style="color: #000000;"> Lawrence Fox, who led the (losing) fight against screening in the ABA House of Delegates, adds: “You tell me how an individual client is going to feel when that client learns that the lawyer is now working for the other side . . .

        <span style="color: #000000;">[T]he vicarious disqualification rule is based on a recognition of “the everyday reality that attorneys, working together and practicing law in a professional association, share each other’s, and their clients’, confidential information.” . . . But several cases have questioned this paradigm as representing an outdated view of the practice of law. . . . The instant case illustrates the changing landscape of legal practice—we are concerned with the tainted attorney working in a different geographical office and in a different practice group from the attorneys with responsibility for the litigation. These are not attorneys discussing their cases regularly, passing each other in the hallways, or at risk of accidentally sharing client confidences at lunch. In a situation where the “everyday reality” is no longer that all attorneys in the </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The court cautioned that in some practice settings such as small firms, effective screening would be impossible, and in such settings vicarious disqualification is called for.</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Notice that Rule 1.10<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.10&quot; " /> discusses “screening.” Per Rule 1.0(k), “screened” “denotes the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect.” </p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Based on her empirical study, Susan Shapiro argues that more liberal rules on screening may actually provide better protection to clients than more restrictive approaches. In jurisdictions that generally allow screens, there is typically more stringent internal and external regulation than in jurisdictions that generally do not permit them unless the client consents.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">whether the additional regulation makes the screens sufficiently effective; and which rule best protects relatively powerless and unsophisticated clients who are most in need of protection.

When lawyers leave the firm, their digital case files are electronically sequestered and hard copies are transferred to a locked file cabinet to which only the managing partner of Adams &amp; Adams has access. The managing partner’s responsibilities do not include representing clients. The firm’s file on Matter One includes case memoranda written by the firm’s lawyers, itemized billing sheets and time records, correspondence between Senior Partner and Client One as well as between Senior Partner and other parties involved in Matter One, and receipts for confidential client documents that have subsequently been returned to Client One. These receipts include identifying descriptions of the documents.</span>

Lobbying activities have similarly increased at the state and local level. The number of lawyers assisting these and other organizations has correspondingly escalated. “Governmental relations” work for private clients involves a broad variety of activities, such as providing advice about political and legislative developments; preparing testimony for legislative and administrative hearings; drafting statutes, regulations, and comments; negotiating government contracts; suing governmental bodies; maintaining contacts with public officials and agencies; and coordinating legal, political, and public relations strategies at state, local, and national levels.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Before the Court is Plaintiff City of Cleveland’s Motion to Disqualify Carole Rendon. . . . Plaintiffs seek disqualification of Carole Rendon and her firm, BakerHostetler, from this MDL for alleged violations of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Rendon violated one or both of Rules 1.11(a) and 1.11(c), and that disqualification is, therefore, an appropriate sanction. For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED-IN-PART.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Upon leaving private practice, Carole Rendon served as the Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio (“USAO”) from November 16, 2009–April 30, 2010. Beginning on May 1, 2010, she served as the First Assistant U.S. Attorney until February 5, 2016. On February 6, 2016, Ms. Rendon became The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio and was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 12, 2016. On March 10, 2017, she was forced to resign by President Trump. On May 1, 2017, Ms. Rendon began working at BakerHostetler in the firm’s Cleveland office, and in June of 2017 she began representing Endo in this MDL. She was appointed Defendants’ Co-Liaison Counsel in December of 2017, shortly after the MDL was created.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During Ms. Rendon’s government service in the Northern District of Ohio, the USAO recognized the opioid epidemic as “an unprecedented health care and law enforcement crisis in Northern Ohio,” and in 2013—while Ms. Rendon was First Assistant U.S. Attorney—created the Heroin and Opioid Task Force (“Opioid Task Force” or “Task Force”). “The group brings together a diverse group of stakeholders, including law enforcement, the medical community, people in recovery, treatment professionals, judges, public health professionals, educators and others. It focuses on solutions from four perspectives: law enforcement; education and prevention; healthcare policy; and treatment.” . . . As a function of her appointed office, Ms. Rendon became the Chair of the Task Force on February 6, 2016 when she became the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On October 27, 2017 Cuyahoga County filed a lawsuit against Opioid Manufacturers, Distributors, and Pharmacies (collectively the “MDL Defendants”), including Endo. On December 5, 2017, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation created <span style="font-style: italic;">In Re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation</span>, for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings before this Court. Shortly thereafter, on December 20, 2017, Summit County and the City of Akron filed their own lawsuit against the MDL <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page541" class="pagebreak" title="541">541</span>Defendants, including Endo. Finally, on March 6, 2018, the City of Cleveland filed its suit against the MDL Defendants, including Endo. Plaintiff Cuyahoga County first raised the issue of Ms. Rendon’s potential disqualification from the MDL in an August 3, 2018 letter to Ms. Rendon. After the parties failed to reach a resolution, on January 10, 2019, Cleveland filed the present Motion to Disqualify Ms. Rendon. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court thus examines whether Ms. Rendon violated one of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. First, Plaintiffs assert that Ms. Rendon violated Rule 1.11(a), which provides in relevant part:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lawyer who has formerly served as a public officer or employee of the government shall . . . not otherwise represent a client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and <span style="font-style: italic;">substantially</span> as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency gives its <span style="font-style: italic;">informed consent, confirmed in writing</span>, to the representation. </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Ohio R. Prof. Conduct 1.11(a) (emphasis in original). There is no doubt that Ms. Rendon participated personally and substantially as a public officer on the Task Force. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court finds that Rule 1.11(a) is not implicated here. At its core, Rule 1.11(a) is a rule that prevents “side-switching” when a government lawyer goes into private practice (or vice versa). To allow a government lawyer to leave public service for private practice and also prevent the government lawyer from, in fact, switching sides, the rule expressly requires that the “matter” that the government lawyer worked on be the same, instead of merely “substantially related” as required by Rule 1.9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Compare</span> Ohio R. Prof. Conduct 1.9(a) (lawyer “shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter”), <span style="font-style: italic;">with</span> Ohio R. Prof. Conduct 1.11, Cmt. [10] (providing guidance for “determining whether two particular matters are the same,” but not for determining whether they are substantially related). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In arguing that the Opioid Task Force and the Opioid Multidistrict Litigation are the same “matter,” Plaintiffs’ reading of Rule 1.11(c) [sic<span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1197" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1197" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span>] sweeps too broadly. The Opioid Task Force is a group of agencies, organizations, and individuals with a stake in their community that share a common goal of finding a multi-pronged solution to the opioid crisis. The cases brought by Track One Plaintiffs are civil actions brought against manufacturers (including Endo), distributors and retailers of prescription opiates alleging liability for the cost of addressing the opioid public health crisis. Plaintiffs allege false marketing and inadequate monitoring of suspicious order reports. They cannot be deemed the “same matter” within a fair construction of the rule. Nor did Ms. Rendon “switch sides” in this case. Ms. Rendon was a lawyer for the U.S. Government. In that role, as part of the Opioid Task Force, Ms. Rendon did not conduct <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page542" class="pagebreak" title="542">542</span>any investigation into any conduct of Endo, nor was she involved in any claim or case against Endo. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Therefore, the Court concludes that the Opioid Task Force and the Opioid Multidistrict Litigation are not the same matter. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">IV.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Plaintiffs also assert that Ms. Rendon violated Rule 1.11(c), which provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer having information that the lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">knows</span> is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee, may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. As used in this rule, the term “confidential government information” means information that has been obtained under governmental authority and that, at the time this rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and that is not otherwise available to the public.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Ohio R. Prof. Conduct 1.11(c) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs assert that Ms. Rendon received confidential government information about Plaintiffs City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County through her role as the head of the Opioid Task Force. In pleadings and through Ms. Rendon’s testimony at the February 6, 2019 hearing, Endo denied this was the case. At the conclusion of the February 6, 2019 hearing, the Court stated that it would ask the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation into this issue. By letter dated March 15, 2019 from Senior Trial Counsel, Lisa A. Olson, (Exh. A) the Department of Justice responded that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Cuyahoga County and Cleveland law enforcement officials shared nonpublic information with Ms. Rendon and her direct reports as a result of the cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in combatting the opioid crisis. This information was conveyed primarily in meetings (e.g., “sidebars”) and communications arising out of the Task Force, and was shared in a spirit of confidence and trust. The information concerned the inadequate staffing levels, funding deficiencies, strategies, initiatives, operations, and allocation of resources at the county and local levels for dealing with the opioid crisis.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The Court concludes, based upon its understanding of this litigation, that this confidential non-public information may go to the heart of Plaintiffs’ damages claims, and this information, if used by Endo could, “materially prejudice” Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The Court, therefore, further concludes that it would not be appropriate for Ms. Rendon to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page543" class="pagebreak" title="543">543</span>continue to represent Endo in the litigation brought by the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Plaintiffs also ask that Ms. Rendon’s firm, BakerHostetler, be disqualified “unless and until it complies with the screening requirements set forth in Rules 1.11(b) and 1.11(c).” Rule 1.11(b) applies only when a lawyer is disqualified per subsection (a), which is not the case here. Rule 1.11(c) provides that: “A <span style="font-style: italic;">firm</span> with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">timely</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> screened </span>from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.” Ohio R. Prof. Cond. 1.11(c) (emphasis added). Attorneys from BakerHostetler have worked with Ms. Rendon on the Opioid Litigation since she began representing Endo in June of 2017. There is no way for BakerHostetler to timely screen Ms. Rendon at this point, almost two years later. The Court must, therefore, also disqualify BakerHostetler to the same extent that it has disqualified Ms. Rendon. Specifically, BakerHostetler may not represent Endo in the litigation brought by the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, but may continue to represent Endo in any other case.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">V.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . . [T]he Court believes Ms. Rendon is an excellent attorney and that she served the U.S. Attorney’s Office with great distinction. Her work on the Consent Decree will benefit the citizens of this area for years to come. There has never been a litigation such as the Opioid MDL, where now approximately 1,600 cities and counties have sued the manufacturers and distributors of prescription opioids, along with a number of pharmacies. Plaintiffs have asserted novel legal theories and are seeking to recoup billions of taxpayer dollars which have been spent, and will continue to be spent, in dealing with this epidemic. As detailed above, the Court concludes that under the unique facts of this case, it is not appropriate for Ms. Rendon, or her firm, to represent Endo in a trial against the City of Cleveland or Cuyahoga County.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, the Court is also sympathetic to the policy implication raised by the amicus Letter of Former Attorneys General. The Letter addresses the same policy consideration considered by Comment [4] of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct. Comment [4] states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">This rule represents a balancing of interests. On the one hand, where the successive clients are a government agency and another client, public or private, the risk exists that power or discretion vested in that agency might be used for the special benefit of the other client. . . . On the other hand, the rules governing lawyers presently or formerly employed by a government agency should not be so restrictive as to inhibit transfer of employment to and from the government. The government has a legitimate need to attract qualified lawyers as well as to maintain high ethical standards.</p>

        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />This is not the only disqualification motion in the vast and extraordinarily high-stakes multidistrict opiates litigation, which consolidates more than 2,600 cases initiated by counties, cities, tribes, and municipalities. In September 2019, several defendant companies moved that Judge Polster recuse himself from the MDL on grounds of bias, as he pressed hard for the parties to settle and made statements about the human costs of the opioid crisis. Judge Polster declined the motion.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Legal ethics and mass tort expert Howard Erichson commented: “After nearly two years of litigation, and on the eve of trial, the defendants decided they didn’t want the judge because they didn’t get favorable rulings. That doesn’t work.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1199" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1199" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The judge had scheduled two “bellwether” trials of county lawsuits against opioid manufacturers; after the failed motion to recuse, the cases settled on the eve of trial. As this book goes to press, Judge Polster has scheduled two more “bellwether” trials, against pharmaceutical chain defendants.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Note that Rule 1.11(a) bars lawyers from accepting private employment in a matter in which they participated personally and substantially as public employees, even if their representation would not be adverse to their former employer’s. This prohibition is broader than the general conflicts rules regarding successive representation. (Recall, the general rule, Rule 1.9(a), bars representation on “the same or a substantially related matter,” only if the new client’s interests are “materially adverse” to the former client’s interests.) What is the rationale for broader coverage?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Along with current and former clients, the Rules endeavor to protect prospective clients who may reveal confidential information in the midst of an initial consultation—but who may not, for whatever reason, subsequently enter into a client-lawyer relationship. Until the 2002 amendments to the Model Rules, there was no explicit rule protecting prospective clients against potential abuse. Now, Rule 1.18<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.18&quot; \s &quot;1.18&quot; \c 16 " /></span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client.</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the lawyer who received the information took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the prospective client; and</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Note that the protections in Rule 1.18<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.18&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> closely track the protections Rule 1.9 affords to former clients. As in Rule 1.9<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.9&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the lawyer who has received confidential information from a prospective client may not represent an adverse party in the same or a substantially related matter. Likewise, as in Rule 1.10<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.10&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, if the lawyer is disqualified, the disqualification is imputed to her entire law firm unless the lawyer is screened. As in conflicts under Rule 1.9, the prospective client can waive the Rule’s protections. The only substantive difference in the protections is an additional requirement that the lawyer “took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the prospective client.”</span>

      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the sparse case law on Rule 1.18<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.18&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">, a common scenario is divorce actions, in which both spouses ask the same lawyer to represent them (perhaps because both know the lawyer), and the lawyer chooses to represent one. The lawyer may have learned information from both, and she faces a motion to disqualify by the spouse the lawyer chose not to represent. The question under Rule 1.18(c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.18(c)&quot; \s &quot;1.18(c)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> is whether that information is “significantly harmful” to the spouse moving for disqualification. For example, in a post-divorce custody dispute, husband Timothy told lawyer Heather “everything he knew regarding the children and his concerns about his former wife,” but eventually retained other counsel.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> When it turned out that another lawyer in Heather’s firm was representing Timothy’s ex-wife, the firm was disqualified, even though Timothy testified that he had not told Heather anything that would be harmful to him. The Arkansas Supreme Court reasoned that prospective clients are not in a position to know which pieces </span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> In other cases, courts have found that merely speculative harms are not enough for disqualification.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One crucial question is what counts as “consulting” with a lawyer, thereby rendering the consulter a prospective client? For example, if someone responds to lawyer advertising, is that response a “consultation”? Comment 2 to Rule 1.18<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.18&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> explains that that will depend on whether the advertisement “specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer’s obligations.” If so, it is likely to count as a consultation. If, by contrast, the advertisement “merely describes the lawyer’s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest,” then someone who unilaterally provides information to the lawyer is not a prospective client. That person has no “reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship.”</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">If the prospective client contacts the lawyer by telephone, the lawyer can end the conversation before the client shares any confidences. But what if the prospective client responds to a lawyer’s advertisement with an email that reveals sensitive information? In such a case, what counts as taking “reasonable measures” to avoid exposure to disqualifying information? Must the lawyer delete the email without reading it? If the lawyer reads it, is he or she disqualified from representing the sender’s adversary? Comment 2 suggests that the answer is “no,” provided the advertisement did not solicit such information. But why not? Should prospective clients be expected to know the finer points of rules governing confidentiality and formation of client-lawyer relationships? Why wouldn’t a client who encounters even a minimum lawyer advertisement stating credentials and contact information have a “reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship”? Why else is the lawyer advertising? </span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">On the other hand, if unilateral communication </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">is</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> enough to trigger Rule 1.18(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.18(c)&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> disqualification, a strategic party might send emails containing confidential information to every family lawyer in the county to conflict them out of representing the spouse in an upcoming divorce. Comment 2 to the Rule aims to address this by clarifying that a “person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a ‘prospective client.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What if a lawyer is active on social media? An ethics opinion of the D.C. Bar explains:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">The guidance of Rule 1.18<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.18&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> is of particular importance in social networking, where lawyers may self-identify themselves as attorneys and where, most likely, those “connected” to the lawyer will be aware that the user is an attorney; however, without more, </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page548" class="pagebreak" title="548">548</span>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">the mere knowledge that a friend is an attorney does not give rise to a reasonable expectation that interactions with that attorney would create a prospective or actual client relationship, or its attendant duty of confidentiality.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">On the other hand, the opinion also cautions that lawyers must “avoid the acquisition of uninvited information through social media sites that could create actual or perceived conflicts of interest for the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. Caution should be exercised when stating positions on issues.” For those lawyers who are used to lively give-and-take on their social media sites, what guidance does this opinion offer? If a Facebook friend who lives in your state imprudently posts some sensitive information to all her “friends” and makes noises about suing somebody, can you join in the extended back-and-forth chatter among the “friends,” or would that run the risk of establishing a reasonable expectation that the poster is now your prospective client?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A final constellation of conflicts involves conflicts between the lawyer and client. Lawyers undeniably owe their clients a duty of loyalty. As such, they must always act in a manner consistent with the client’s best interests, or, as Rule 1.7, comment 10 puts it: “The lawyer’s own interests should not be permitted to have an adverse effect on representation of a client.” Furthermore, lawyers must abide by Rule 1.7(a)(2), which advises that a lawyer shall not represent a client if “there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by . . . a personal interest of the lawyer,” unless the client gives written informed consent, and “the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation.” Finally, when it comes to lawyer-client relations, Rule 1.8 offers a menu of specific admonitions, on matters ranging from lawyer-client business transactions (which, as noted below, are heavily regulated), to the solicitation of gifts from a client (a no-no), to the provision of financial assistance to a client (only very narrowly allowed), to the forging of aggregate settlements (also regulated), to sexual relations with a client (also strictly forbidden).</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Fees Act) provides that “the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee” in enumerated civil rights actions. . . . In this case, we consider the question whether attorney’s fees </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">must</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> be assessed when the case has been settled by a consent decree granting prospective relief to the plaintiff class but providing that the defendants shall not pay any part of the prevailing party’s fees or costs. We hold that the District Court has the power, in its sound discretion, to refuse to award fees.</span>

      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The petitioners are the Governor and other public officials of the State of Idaho responsible for the education and treatment of children who suffer from emotional and mental handicaps. Respondents are a class of such children who have been or will be placed in petitioners’ care.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On August 4, 1980, respondents commenced this action by filing a complaint against petitioners in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho. The factual allegations in the complaint described deficiencies in both the educational programs and the health care services provided respondents. . . . The complaint prayed for injunctive relief and for an award of costs and attorney’s fees, but it did not seek damages.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On the day the complaint was filed, the District Court . . . appoint[ed] Charles Johnson as [respondents’] next friend for the sole purpose of instituting and prosecuting the action. At that time Johnson was employed by the Idaho Legal Aid Society, Inc., a private, nonprofit corporation that provides free legal services to qualified low-income persons. Because the Idaho Legal Aid Society is prohibited from representing clients who are capable of paying their own fees, it made no agreement requiring any of the respondents to pay for the costs of litigation or the legal services it provided through Johnson. Moreover, the special character of both the class and its attorney-client relationship with Johnson explains why it did not enter into any agreement covering the various contingencies that might arise during the course of settlement negotiations of a class action of this kind. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In March 1983, one week before trial, petitioners presented respondents with a new settlement proposal. As respondents themselves </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page550" class="pagebreak" title="550">550</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">characterize it, the proposal “offered virtually all of the injunctive relief [they] had sought in their complaint.” The Court of Appeals agreed with this characterization, and further noted that the proposed relief was “more than the district court in earlier hearings had indicated it was willing to grant.” As was true of the earlier partial settlement, however, petitioners’ offer included a provision for a waiver by respondents of any claim to fees or costs. Originally, this waiver was unacceptable to the Idaho Legal Aid Society, which had instructed Johnson to reject any settlement offer conditioned upon a waiver of fees, but Johnson ultimately determined that his ethical obligation to his clients mandated acceptance of the proposal. The parties conditioned the waiver on approval by the District Court.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">After the stipulation was signed, Johnson filed a written motion requesting the District Court to approve the settlement “except for the provision on costs and attorney’s fees,” and to allow respondents to present a bill of costs and fees for consideration by the court. At the oral argument on that motion, Johnson contended that petitioners’ offer had exploited his ethical duty to his clients—that he was “forced,” by an offer giving his clients “the best result [they] could have gotten in this court or any other court,” to waive his attorney’s fees. The District Court, however, evaluated the waiver in the context of the entire settlement and rejected the ethical underpinnings of Johnson’s argument. . . . The Court of Appeals . . . after ordering preliminary relief . . . invalidated the fee waiver and left standing the remainder of the settlement; it then instructed the District Court to “make its own determination of the fees that are reasonable” and remanded for that limited purpose.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In explaining its holding, the Court of Appeals emphasized that </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> gives the court the power to approve the terms of all settlements of class actions . . . The court added that “[w]hen attorney’s fees are negotiated as part of a class action settlement, a conflict frequently exists between the class lawyers’ interest in compensation and the class members’ interest in relief.” “To avoid this conflict,” the Court of Appeals relied on Circuit precedent which had “disapproved simultaneous negotiation of settlements and attorney’s fees” absent a showing of “unusual circumstances.” In this case, the Court of Appeals found no such “unusual circumstances” and therefore held that an agreement on fees “should not have been a part of the settlement of the claims of the class.” . . . We now reverse.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . To begin with, the Court of Appeals’ decision rested on an erroneous view of the District Court’s power to approve settlements in class actions. </span>
        <a id="dabmci_10fc6d60030d4051aab02a91ce0024d3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;">Rule 23(e)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> wisely requires court approval of the terms of any settlement of a class action, but the power to approve or reject a settlement negotiated by the parties before trial does not authorize the court to require the parties to accept a settlement to which they have not agreed. . . . The question we must decide, therefore, is whether the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page551" class="pagebreak" title="551">551</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">District Court had a duty to reject the proposed settlement because it included a waiver of statutorily authorized attorney’s fees.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">That duty, whether it takes the form of a general prophylactic rule or arises out of the special circumstances of this case, derives ultimately from the Fees Act rather than from the strictures of professional ethics. Although respondents contend that Johnson, as counsel for the class, was faced with an “ethical dilemma” when petitioners offered him relief greater than that which he could reasonably have expected to obtain for his clients at trial (if only he would stipulate to a waiver of the statutory fee award), and although we recognize Johnson’s conflicting interests between pursuing relief for the class and a fee for the Idaho Legal Aid Society, we do not believe that the “dilemma” was an “ethical” one in the sense that Johnson had to choose between conflicting duties under the prevailing norms of professional conduct. Plainly, Johnson had no </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">ethical</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> obligation to seek a statutory fee award. His ethical duty was to serve his clients loyally and competently. Since the proposal to settle the merits was more favorable than the probable outcome of the trial, Johnson’s decision to recommend acceptance was consistent with the highest standards of our profession. The District Court, therefore, correctly concluded that approval of the settlement involved no breach of ethics in this case. . . . For reasons set out below, we are not persuaded that Congress has commanded that all such settlements must be rejected by the District Court. Moreover, on the facts of record in this case, we are satisfied that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by approving the fee waiver.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The text of the Fees Act provides no support for the proposition that Congress intended to ban all fee waivers offered in connection with substantial relief on the merits. . . . In fact, we believe that a general proscription against negotiated waiver of attorney’s fees in exchange for a settlement on the merits would itself impede vindication of civil rights, at least in some cases, by reducing the attractiveness of settlement. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Most defendants are unlikely to settle unless the cost of the predicted judgment, discounted by its probability, plus the transaction costs of further litigation, are greater than the cost of the settlement package. If fee waivers cannot be negotiated, the settlement package must either contain an attorney’s fee component of potentially large and typically uncertain magnitude, or else the parties must agree to have the fee fixed by the court. Although either of these alternatives may well be acceptable in many cases, there surely is a significant number in which neither alternative will be as satisfactory as a decision to try the entire case. . . .</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> who support them never suggest that the district court is obligated to place its stamp of approval on every settlement in which the plaintiffs’ attorneys have agreed to a fee waiver. The Solicitor General, for example, has suggested that a fee waiver need not be approved when the defendant had “no realistic defense on the merits,” or if the waiver was part of a “vindictive effort . . . to teach counsel that they had better not bring such cases.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">We find it unnecessary to evaluate this argument, however, because the record in this case does not indicate that Idaho has adopted such a statute, policy, or practice. Nor does the record support the narrower proposition that petitioners’ request to waive fees was a vindictive effort to deter attorneys from representing plaintiffs in civil rights suits against Idaho. . . .</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Ultimately, enforcement of the laws is what really counts. It was with this in mind that Congress enacted the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976. Congress authorized fee shifting to improve enforcement of civil rights legislation by making it easier for victims of civil rights violations to find lawyers willing to take their cases. Because today’s decision will make it more difficult for civil rights plaintiffs to obtain legal assistance, a result plainly contrary to Congress’ purpose, I dissent.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . It seems obvious that allowing defendants in civil rights cases to condition settlement of the merits on a waiver of statutory attorney’s fees will diminish lawyers’ expectations of receiving fees and decrease the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page553" class="pagebreak" title="553">553</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">willingness of lawyers to accept civil rights cases. Even the Court acknowledges “the possibility that decisions by individual clients to bargain away fee awards may, in the aggregate and in the long run, diminish lawyers’ expectations of statutory fees in civil rights cases.” The Court tells us, however, that “[c]omment on this issue” is “premature at this juncture” because there is not yet supporting “documentation.” The Court then goes on anyway to observe that “as a practical matter the likelihood of this circumstance arising is remote.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I must say that I find the Court’s assertions somewhat difficult to understand. To be sure, the impact of conditional fee waivers on the availability of attorneys will be less severe than was the restriction on fee awards created in </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Alyeska.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> However, that experience surely provides an indication of the immediate hardship suffered by civil rights claimants whenever there is a reduction in the availability of attorney’s fee awards. . . . And, of course, once fee waivers are permitted, defendants will seek them as a matter of course, since this is a logical way to minimize liability. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">This all seems so obvious that it is puzzling that the Court reaches a different result. The Court’s rationale is that, unless fee waivers are permitted, “parties to a significant number of civil rights cases will refuse to settle. . . .” This is a wholly inadequate justification for the Court’s result.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">First,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> the effect of prohibiting fee waivers on settlement offers is just not an important concern in the context of the Fees Act. I agree with the Court that encouraging settlements is desirable policy. But it is </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">judicially</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> created policy, applicable to litigation of any kind and having no special force in the context of civil rights cases. The </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">congressional</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> policy underlying the Fees Act is, as I have argued throughout, to create incentives for lawyers to devote time to civil rights cases by making it economically feasible for them to do so. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Second,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> even assuming that settlement practices are relevant, the Court greatly exaggerates the effect that prohibiting fee waivers will have on defendants’ willingness to make settlement offers. This is largely due to the Court’s failure to distinguish the fee waiver issue from the issue of simultaneous negotiation of fees and merits claims. The Court’s discussion mixes concerns over a defendant’s reluctance to settle because total liability remains uncertain with reluctance to settle because the cost of settling is too high. However, it is a prohibition on simultaneous negotiation, not a prohibition on fee waivers, that makes it difficult for the defendant to ascertain his total liability at the time he agrees to settle the merits. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Court asserts, without factual support, that requiring defendants to pay statutory fee awards will prevent a “significant number” of settlements. It is, of course, ironic that the same absence of “documentation” which makes comment on the effects of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">permitting</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> fee waivers “premature at this juncture,” does not similarly affect the Court’s </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page554" class="pagebreak" title="554">554</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">willingness to speculate about what to expect if fee waivers are </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">prohibited.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Be that as it may, I believe that the Court overstates the extent to which prohibiting fee waivers will deter defendants from making settlement offers. Because the parties can negotiate a fee (or a range of fees) that is not unduly high and condition their settlement on the court’s approval of this fee, the magnitude of a defendant’s liability for fees in the settlement context need be neither uncertain nor particularly great. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">I would, on the other hand, permit simultaneous negotiation of fees and merits claims, since this would not contravene the purposes of the Fees Act. . . .</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, a settlement offer requiring a waiver of attorney fees presents no ethical conflict since lawyers are under no ethical obligation to seek statutory fees. Is this view convincing, or should the Court have considered lawyers’ responsibilities to their employers or to other nonpaying clients, whose representation is subsidized in part by statutory fee awards? For example, Charles Silver argues that the fee-waiver issue reflects a tradeoff: Some victims who can sue do better if waivers are allowed, while others denied representation do worse. In Silver’s view, the majority opinion in </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Jeff D.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> is problematic in that it “cites no evidence tending to show that the former gain more than the latter lose, and offers no guidance on how to compare the effects on the two groups.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> The goal of this restriction was to insulate public interest lawyers from the “pressure of having to reduce their fees to bring a settlement within reach, particularly in those cases where damages are low and attorneys’ fees are high.”</span>

In determining statutory fees, courts generally take as a starting point the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In dissent, Justice Blackmun took a different and more pragmatic view. He noted:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Congress’ purpose in adopting fee-shifting provisions was to strengthen the enforcement of selected federal laws by ensuring that private persons seeking to enforce those laws could retain competent counsel. In particular, federal fee-shifting provisions have been designed to address two related difficulties that otherwise would prevent private persons from obtaining counsel. First, many potential plaintiffs lack sufficient resources to hire attorneys. Second, many of the statutes to which Congress attached fee-shifting provisions typically will generate either no damages or only small recoveries; accordingly, plaintiffs bringing cases under these statutes cannot offer attorneys a share of a recovery sufficient to justify a standard contingent-fee arrangement. The strategy of the fee-shifting provisions is to attract competent counsel to selected federal cases by ensuring that if they prevail, counsel will receive fees commensurable with what they could obtain in other litigation. If federal fee-bearing litigation is less remunerative than private litigation, then the only attorneys who will take such cases will be underemployed lawyers-who likely will be less competent than the successful, busy lawyers who would shun federal fee-bearing litigation-and public interest lawyers who, by any measure, are insufficiently numerous to handle all the cases for which other competent attorneys cannot be found.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In many cases brought under federal statutes that authorize fee shifting, plaintiffs will be unable to ensure that their attorneys will be compensated for the risk that they might not prevail. This will be true in precisely those situations targeted by the fee-shifting statutes—where plaintiffs lack sufficient funds to hire an attorney on a win-or-lose basis and where potential damages awards are insufficient to justify a standard contingent-fee arrangement. In these situations, unless the fee-shifting statutes are construed to </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page557" class="pagebreak" title="557">557</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">compensate attorneys for the risk of nonpayment associated with loss, the expected return from cases brought under federal fee-shifting provisions will be less than could be obtained in otherwise comparable private litigation offering guaranteed, win-or-lose compensation. Prudent counsel, under these conditions, would tend to avoid federal fee-bearing claims in favor of private litigation, even in the very situations for which the attorney’s fee statutes were designed. This will be true even if the fee-bearing claim is more likely meritorious than the competing private claim.</span>

In so doing, the Court relied on a formalistic dictionary definition of the term “prevailing party” as “one who has been awarded some relief by the court” and expressly rejected the catalyst theory, long accepted by lower courts, which had authorized fees as long as the litigation was the “catalyst” to relief. </span>

This would, in the long term, “impede access to the court for the less well heeled” and discourage suits by plaintiffs with claims that were meritorious but expensive to litigate. </span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Your firm represents a migrant farmworkers’ organization in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Labor for failure to enforce certain protective legislation. You personally believe that the odds of obtaining any relief in court are only about 30 percent, but you hope that the costs and adverse publicity involved in litigation will prod the Department to reassess its enforcement priorities and settle the case on favorable terms. Your firm is currently subsidizing the lawsuit on a pro bono basis, but firm partners hope to recoup some expenses under a federal fee-shifting statute. That statute has been construed to authorize recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs for a party who “prevails” in litigation, or who obtains substantial relief through settlement.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Your fondest hopes are realized. After two years of litigation, the Department comes up with what you believe is a reasonably adequate enforcement policy in light of its budget constraints. The changes exceed what you believe a court would order, and the Department’s lawyers assure you that if the case goes to trial, they will challenge the legal authority of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">any</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> group to question Department priorities. As part of the proposed agreement, the Department agrees to a substantial attorneys’ fee award. They also invite your firm to serve as a paid consultant to the government in its development of future enforcement policy.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Delighted, you take this settlement offer to your clients. Much to your dismay, however, you find that the leaders of your client organization are unwilling to compromise in any respect and want to pursue their claim for full enforcement. When you share this unwelcome development with your law firm partners, they point out that they already have been subsidizing this litigation for an extended period. If the client refuses to settle, they wish to withdraw. When you convey this to your client’s leaders, they are incensed and intransigent. At this stage, they believe that withdrawal would substantially prejudice their interests. You have been unable to find qualified counsel willing to replace you. What are your options?</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page559" class="pagebreak" title="559">559</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Now suppose, alternatively, that your fondest hopes are not realized. Rather, the Department proposes to satisfy your client by vigorously enforcing regulations in only the regions that affect its members. Such a policy would leave 90 percent of the migrant workforce unprotected. Moreover, as part of the proposed agreement, defendants insist that you waive attorneys’ fees, agree not to represent other migrant groups, and return key documents related to the case.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Since you already have invested substantial efforts in trying to effect policy changes that will help migrant workers generally, you strongly oppose this settlement. You also believe that agreeing to the fee waiver will jeopardize funding for other pro bono matters at your firm. However, you suspect that the leaders of your client organization may prefer the settlement, particularly if you disclose that you believe the odds of ultimately gaining judicial relief are strongly against them. A victory against the Department could also build support for your clients’ organizing campaign and serve as a catalyst to further collective efforts.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">What are your obligations to the client leadership, your law firm, and to migrant workers generally?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

Could, or should, you have dealt with the problem by drafting a retainer agreement limiting your firm’s commitment? Would such a strategy institutionalize a double standard of representation, which reserves zealous advocacy only for clients who can afford it? Alternatively, would such retainers be the most practical way of encouraging private attorneys to accept pro bono cases that could become unexpectedly expensive and difficult?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The lawyer’s and the client’s interests also may collide concerning whether to accept a so-called “secret settlement.” A secret settlement is a settlement that contains a provision (often in the form of a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA) requiring the plaintiff to keep confidential the settlement amount, relevant terms, and, often, all facts of the underlying controversy. These secrecy provisions are often backed up by steep liquidated damage provisions, should the lawyer or client breach the agreement. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Some penalties for disclosure are draconian. For example, it recently came to light that the multi-million-dollar settlements that long shielded now-disgraced former Fox News Host Bill O’Reilly from accountability required those who had credibly accused O’Reilly of sexual harassment to “not talk about, write about, publicize, make available or otherwise disclose any information concerning . . . O’Reilly or any conduct or actions by O’Reilly.” Accusers further agreed that if they ever did disclose such </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page560" class="pagebreak" title="560">560</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">information, they would be forced to disgorge all money they had received, forfeit their right to any future payments, and pay O’Reilly’s legal fees. Accusers also agreed to turn over all evidence of O’Reilly’s harassment, including audio recordings and diaries—and one accuser went so far as to promise that she would disclaim the materials as “counterfeit and forgeries” if they ever became public.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1217" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1217" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Though most settlement agreements do not go as far as the contract above, settlements containing non-disclosure provisions are very common. And they are increasingly controversial, particularly when the plaintiff’s case involves criminal conduct or a public health hazard, and, as part of the settlement, the plaintiff agrees to keep that conduct or hazard confidential. As the above discussion of O’Reilly indicates, this concern is not academic. In the past, such provisions were used to shield clergy sexual abuse and the alleged repeated sexual misconduct of Leslie Moonves, Harvey Weinstein, R. Kelly, Roger Ailes, Bill Cosby, and the former USA Gymnastics national team doctor, Larry Nasser. Secret settlements were also used in cases involving hazards (or alleged hazards) such as the Dalkon Shield, Dow Corning’s silicone gel breast implants, pickup trucks made by Ford and General Motors, Zomax, opioids, and cigarettes. If these settlements had been public, scores of victims presumably would have been spared.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Indeed, just one commonly cited example includes the confidential resolution of personal injury claims arising from Firestone/Bridgestone tires on Ford sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Over 140 deaths have been linked to the public’s and regulators’ lack of awareness of that danger.</span>

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">When offered a secret settlement, a plaintiff’s lawyer faces a vexing ethical dilemma. Recall from Chapter 5, per Rule 1.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.2(a)&quot; \s &quot;Rule 1.2(a)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, that the client controls the decision whether to settle a civil controversy. That provision provides, in no uncertain terms: “[A] lawyer shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation,” and “[a] lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter.” Clients often, quite reasonably, </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">want</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> secrecy—either because they are hesitant to broadcast what transpired, because an acquiescence to secrecy will hasten the litigation’s end, or because secrecy might sweeten the terms the defendant will offer to resolve the simmering controversy. (Eager to keep its misbehavior under wraps, a defendant is likely to offer more if </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page561" class="pagebreak" title="561">561</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">the settlement contains a secrecy provision.) But many lawyers don’t like sitting idly by in the face of grievous wrongdoing.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Underscoring this latter point, some lawyers who have agreed to secret settlements have come to bitterly regret that decision. One such lawyer is Massachusetts attorney Jeffrey Newman. In the early 2000s, Newman represented more than 200 people who alleged they were the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of a dozen priests in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. For a time, Newman was, as he put it, “in the clergy suit business wholesale.” However, in three early lawsuits against priests, including two early lawsuits involving now-disgraced Priest John J. Geoghan, Newman agreed to keep quiet about the victims’ charges in exchange for settlement money. (Ultimately, Geoghan, who was accused of molesting between 150 and 200 children, was defrocked and imprisoned for his crimes.) Of his decision to agree to secrecy, which apparently prolonged Geoghan’s time in the ministry, Newman told </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New York Times</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">: “It was a terrible mistake,” he said, “and I think people were harmed by it.” “I feel strongly,” he continued, “that I was complicit in not recognizing the significance and extent of the problem. I, among other lawyers, was part of the problem. It was probably one of the poorest decisions I made in my career.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1220" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Others share the view that Newman (and other lawyers like him) were, in part, to blame: “If you know your client’s been raped by a priest and you settle the case confidentially, knowing that the priest could go out and do it again, your hands aren’t entirely clean.”</span>
        <a id="_Ref33561304" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Yet, there is a question of what even those lawyers who are dead set against secrecy clauses </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">can</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> do, in light of Rule 1.2(a) and other norms of fidelity, loyalty, and zealous advocacy. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Believing that the current Rules offer little protection to lawyers who oppose secret settlements, some favor amendments to the current regulatory architecture. Most notably, Richard Zitrin, a longtime critic of the status quo, proposes the following addition to Rule 3.2.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some settlements have been facilitated by agreements to limit the public’s access to information obtained both by investigation and through the discovery process. However, the public’s interest in being free from substantial dangers to health and safety requires that no agreement that prevents disclosure to the public of information that directly affects that health and safety may be permitted</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">[3]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Subsection (b) does not require the disclosure of the amount of any settlement. Further, in the event of a danger to any particular individual(s) under Subsection (b), the rule is intended to require only that the availability of information about the danger not be restricted from any persons reasonably likely to be affected, and from any governmental regulatory or oversight agencies that would have a substantial interest in that danger. In such instances, the rule is not intended to permit disclosure to persons not affected by the dangers.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But Zitrin has, so far, had little success. The ABA Ethics 2000 Commission considered but rejected the proposed amendment, unanimously agreeing “that the ethics rules were not the vehicle for solving this problem.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1223" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1223" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> And, in general, the ABA has taken the position that changes are not necessary because “complaints and other documents that are a matter of public record typically contain sufficient details about the alleged hazard or harm to apprise the public of the risk, the source of the risk, and the harm it allegedly causes.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Others, too, worry that such an amendment would erode client autonomy—that clients should be allowed to forge a settlement if they want to, and the Model Rules should not burden or interfere with that choice.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Finally, still other critics charge that outlawing secret settlements will have negative repercussions, including fueling lengthy discovery fights, encouraging document destruction, and deterring the timely and consensual resolution of disputes.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Challenging the last point, reformers counter that some states (most notably, Florida, Washington, and Texas) curtail certain secret settlements via legislative prohibitions, and, in those states, there is no evidence that the legislation has prolonged litigation or deterred the consensual resolution of claims.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Proponents also point out that secrecy provisions impose problems of their own.

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Similar finger-pointing followed the Firestone tire debacle, where accidental deaths “piled up” for nearly a decade before the public or regulators became aware that driving on certain Firestone tires posed a substantial risk. During those years—even as casualties mounted—Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co. quietly resolved many wrongful death lawsuits with settlements that contained broad secrecy clauses, requiring the return of all discovery material and barring all parties from discussing aspects of each case.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Plaintiffs’ lawyer Rowe Brogdon of Statesboro, Georgia was involved in one of these lawsuits. Brogdon represented the parents of a nineteen-year-old victim, Daniel Paul Van Etten, a West Virginia University football player who was killed in 1997, after the left rear Firestone tire separated on his family’s Ford Explorer, causing the vehicle to flip and roll on highway I-95. Daniel’s parents ultimately accepted a secret settlement to resolve their son’s wrongful death claim, and, pursuant to its terms, returned all the documents the tire-maker had disclosed in discovery. Of his decision to assist Daniel’s parents in acquiescing to the secret settlement, Brogdon stated: “You’re there to represent your client, not . . . the world, although you wish you could. . . . Ethically, there’s no question that you have to do what’s in the best interest of the client.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When it comes to secret settlements, the #MeToo movement is spurring at least limited change. Since early 2018, lawmakers in at least twenty-six states have introduced bills to restrict non-disclosure agreements in </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page564" class="pagebreak" title="564">564</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> One such effort is the STAND (Stand Together Against Non-Disclosure) Act, recently enacted in California. Inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the Act voids any provision in a settlement agreement that prevents the disclosure of factual information related to a claim filed in civil court or complaint filed with an administrative agency regarding sexual assault, sexual harassment, or workplace discrimination. While broad, the Act contains two important limitations. First, it applies to “claims filed in a civil action or a complaint filed in an administrative action.” Thus, the Act appears to permit non-disclosure provisions, to the extent the provisions are included in settlements forged prior to the initiation of formal litigation (such as where a demand letter has been sent but no claim has been filed with an administrative agency or in court). Second, the Act gives claimants the option of shielding their own identities and all facts that could lead to the discovery thereof. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Act is popular in some quarters but has also been criticized for </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">requiring</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> victims to sacrifice for the public welfare. Thus, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred has called the Act “a mixed bag” that may well deter settlements and reduce the amount that women recover for claims of sexual harassment or assault.</span>

Your client is alleging that the implants leaked and caused a life-threatening illness. During the discovery process, the defendant breast implant manufacturer offers to let you review certain internal memoranda and unpublished studies, on the condition that you agree not to reveal any of their contents. If you refuse to accept that condition, the defendant will fight your discovery request tooth-and-nail. After consulting with your client, you agree to the non-disclosure provision.

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Attorney buyout agreements raise somewhat similar concerns. Briefly, lawyer buyout agreements (sometimes called “lockout agreements”) are attempts by a party subject to repeated litigation to neutralize an experienced, well-informed adversary by paying off that adversary. Buyout agreements have an extended and unbecoming history. As Judge Jack Weinstein writes:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">One of the earliest reported buyouts resulted from the deaths of more than 700 workers from silicosis caused by the construction of the Hawk’s Nest Tunnel in West Virginia in the early 1930s. The Union Carbide Corporation hired black migrant laborers to work on the project without taking the most minimal safety precautions. Despite substantial resistance by defendants, eventually hundreds of suits were filed. In what was then the longest trial in the country (five weeks), a team of plaintiffs’ lawyers presented 175 witnesses. Since the plaintiffs had limited resources, their attorneys made a considerable investment in the case, hoping that a favorable verdict would lead to a large number of settlements. The jury deadlocked.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Shortly before a second case was to come to trial, seventeen plaintiffs’ lawyers entered into an out-of-court settlement on behalf of 157 claimants. The claimants had asked for $4 million but were given $130,000, half of which went to the attorneys. It was later revealed that the plaintiffs’ attorneys had secretly signed a contract with the tunnel contractor that provided the attorneys, not the clients, with an additional $20,000 if they agreed not to engage in any further legal action. Upon learning of the agreement, the judge ordered that half that sum go to the plaintiffs. Nevertheless, the judge upheld a provision that the plaintiffs’ lawyers surrender all case records to the defendants.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Obviously the Hawk’s Nest attorneys breached their ethical obligations by agreeing to a </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">secret</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> side deal with defendants. But what if they had disclosed the deal, and what if the deal benefited their clients too (let’s say, each client and each lawyer would get an additional $10,000 if the lawyer agreed to forego future representation)?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">One might, as an initial matter, think that such an agreement would be wholly permissible. After all, settlements are favored; the plaintiff and defendant, generally, can settle a matter however they wish; and, under Rule 1.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(a)&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the decision whether to settle rests with the client.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Yet, it turns out that such an agreement would be impermissible under the Model Rules. This type of agreement is unambiguously banned by Rule 5.6, which provides: “A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making . . . (b) an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer’s right to practice is part of the settlement of a client controversy.” </span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The rationale of Model Rule 5.6 is clear. First, permitting such agreements restricts the access of the public to lawyers who, by virtue of their background and experience, might be the very best available talent to represent these individuals. Second, the use of such agreements may provide clients with rewards that bear less relationship to the merits of their claims than they do to the desire of the defendant to “buy off” plaintiff’s counsel. Third, the offering of such restrictive agreements places the plaintiff’s lawyer in a situation where there is conflict between the interests of present clients and those of potential future clients. While the Model Rules generally require that the client’s interests be put first, forcing a lawyer to give up future representations may be asking too much, particularly in light of the strong countervailing policy favoring the public’s unfettered choice of counsel.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">5.6(b) does not just bar lawyers from “making” agreements that restrict the lawyer’s right to practice. It is also inappropriate to </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">offer</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> such an agreement. Thus, in one highly publicized case, a law professor handling a tort claim was suspended for a number of infractions, including violating Rule 5.6(b), by accepting a settlement in which he agreed not to represent future claimants against the defendant. The defendant’s lawyer who proposed the buyout offer was also suspended for one year, on the basis of Rule 5.6(b), as well as Rule 8.4(a), which makes it “professional misconduct” for a lawyer to “violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct [or] knowingly assist or induce another to do so.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />To what extent should the bar seek to regulate restrictions on attorneys’ practice? Are such rules primarily designed to protect counsel, to protect current clients, to protect hypothetical future clients, or to protect the public?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />It is sometimes said that when the public interest in seeing justice done conflicts with the interests of lawyers or the interests of individual clients, the Model Rules consistently advance the interests of lawyers and individual clients.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">To the extent one accepts this critique, does Rule 5.6(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;5.6(b)&quot; " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> fit the script? Or is Rule 5.6(b) exceptional? Does Rule 5.6(b) safeguard the public interest, even at the expense of the interests of individual lawyers or clients?</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to Professor Marc Galanter:</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Our intuition that buyout is bad points to a hard-to-articulate dimension of the distinctive “professional” character of law. Practicing a profession means taking on not only duties to specific clients, but sharing in a collective responsibility to the general public. Part of this responsibility is to serve as trustee of a body of skills and knowledge, to various classes, defined and as yet undefined, within that public. This knowledge can be used for private gain, but there are corresponding obligations to maintain its integrity, to have it grow and adapt to encompass new situations.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">9</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As in Problem 8, you represent the plaintiff in what you believe to be the first product liability suit involving a new form of breast implants. Your client is alleging that the implants leaked and caused a life-threatening illness. Ultimately, after litigating hard for two years and uncovering many “hot” documents that reveal the defendant-manufacturer’s liability, you tentatively agree to settle the controversy. The proffered offer from the defendant requires you to return to the </span>

Consider instead that, shortly after the settlement agreement is inked, the defendant-manufacturer offers to retain you as an “expert consultant” to assist it in any future silicone-implant product liability suits. You will receive a generous annual retainer for nominal responsibilities. Of course, given Rule 1.7, which governs conflicts of interest, if you accept the retention, you will be conflicted out of representing breast implant plaintiffs in product liability suits against the manufacturer in the future. What considerations would affect your decision whether to accept the retention? What Rules, if any, have been violated? To the extent you can ethically become an “expert consultant,” does that change your opinion of Rule 5.6(b) or your answer to Questions 1 and 2 above?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">These days, many suits are pursued in an aggregated fashion, rather than one-by-one. Consequently, particularly in the realm of mass torts, it is not unusual for a single lawyer or law firm to represent hundreds, or even thousands, of injured individuals simultaneously.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1242" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1242" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Litigating claims </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">en masse</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> confers certain benefits. It can arm individual plaintiffs with increased leverage in settlement negotiations. It can also provide plaintiffs’ lawyers helpful economies of scale: While it is not economically feasible for a plaintiffs’ lawyer working on a contingency fee to spend tens of millions of dollars prepping an individual case, that same lawyer can pour more resources into case development if she has 1,000 such cases. She will be able to retain more and more </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page569" class="pagebreak" title="569">569</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">accomplished expert witnesses, conduct depositions of additional fact witnesses, review extra documents in discovery, and master the minutiae of complicated fact patterns—which, in turn, will likely increase plaintiffs’ odds of success. Further, when a defendant’s very existence may be in jeopardy (as it sometimes is when potential liability is massive), joint representation can help to conserve the defendant’s dwindling assets.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But joint representation also has drawbacks. These risks are especially acute when the defendant seeks a global settlement to extinguish all (or nearly all) of a single plaintiffs’ lawyers’ claims in one fell swoop. This global settlement might be to some clients’ advantage, but it might not be in </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">all</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> clients’ best interest (thus raising a clear concurrent conflict). Worse, those clients most predictably shortchanged by global settlements are those with strong claims and serious injuries—and those who, as a consequence, have the most compelling and urgent need for adequate relief.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Compounding these conflicts, the plaintiffs’ lawyer—who may have invested years and millions of dollars pursuing the litigation and, paid via contingency fee, will only be compensated if there is a recovery—will have a strong, and potentially overriding, financial interest in forging a global settlement. Even if a global settlement </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">is</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> reached, the plaintiffs’ lawyer is sometimes put in the awkward and ethically dubious position of allocating the settlement proceeds among her various competing clients.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

        <span style="color: #000000;">Rule 1.8(g) has been adopted in some form in every state.

        <span style="color: #000000;">Citing these concerns, in 2010, the ALI proposed amending Rule 1.8(g) to permit binding advance consent. In essence, “claimants may, prior to the receipt of proposed settlement offer, enter into an agreement through shared counsel allowing each participating claimant to be bound by a substantial majority vote of all claimants concerning an aggregate settlement proposal (or . . . a separate substantial majority vote of each category of claimants).”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, when a lawyer seeks to represent numerous clients simultaneously, the lawyer must (among other things) “reasonably believe[ ] that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client” and must also obtain the client’s “informed consent” to the concurrent conflict “confirmed in writing.” As noted above, informed consent is defined as “the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.” Rule 1.0(e)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.0(e)&quot; \s &quot;1.0(e)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. That begs the question: What information must a lawyer, poised to take on numerous clients all complaining of a particular injury from a given product disclose, up front, to each client regarding the aggregate nature of the representation? What risks must the lawyer convey to each client in order to comply with Rule 1.7(b)? Would prospective clients be better off finding a lawyer who is not representing hundreds or thousands of similarly-situated clients (assuming such a lawyer even exists)? What are the relevant tradeoffs between individualized and aggregate representation?</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Problem </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">10</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Vioxx was a highly successful prescription painkiller, approved by the FDA in May 1999 and ultimately prescribed to some 20 million Americans. However, in the fall of 2004, Merck, the maker of Vioxx, pulled the drug from the market amidst revelations that Vioxx significantly increased users’ risk of heart attacks, strokes, and sudden death. Evidence ultimately came to light indicating that Merck was aware of Vioxx’s cardiovascular risks starting years earlier, but it opted to obscure, rather than disclose, Vioxx’s true risk profile. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">On the heels of these revelations, some 47,000 people filed claims against Merck. As suits piled up, financial analysts predicted potential liability of tens of billions of dollars. As financial analyst James Cramer put it: “When the juries hear that people died because they took a drug meant to relieve shoulder pain, they will destroy Merck, sure as shinola.” </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">As the product liability litigation matured, it became clear that both sides faced substantial risks. Plaintiffs faced an uphill battle establishing specific causation, because many particularly elderly individuals who used Vioxx might have had heart attacks or strokes, even without taking the drug. These causation problems seemed to matter to juries; plaintiffs won only five of the first seventeen cases that went to trial. Also casting a shadow, in the midst of the Vioxx litigation, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on a closely-watched case (</span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Wyeth v. Levine</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">) that had the potential to doom plaintiffs’ claims, as many believed the Court might rule that federal regulations preempted state tort law. On the other hand, evidence of Merck’s concealment of Vioxx’s risks was strong, and the five plaintiffs who had prevailed at trial all were awarded large punitive damages. Further, the litigation was causing Merck to hemorrhage money on legal fees, to the tune of roughly $1 million per day.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">With risks on both sides, thousands of lawsuits pending, and litigation costs mounting, the parties negotiated a settlement. The agreement they ultimately hammered out required Merck to pay $4.85 billion in damages. This dollar value was not extraordinary—but the form of the settlement was. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">For starters, though the seventy-plus-page agreement was titled “SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,” it was not actually an agreement between the injured plaintiffs and defendant Merck. It was, instead, an agreement between Merck and the plaintiffs’ lawyers with a large inventory of Vioxx claims. Further, under the agreement’s terms, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing multiple Vioxx-injured plaintiffs agreed to recommend the settlement to </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">all</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> of their clients. The Agreement, which became binding only if 85 percent of plaintiffs signed on, further provided: “The parties agree that a key objective of the </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page572" class="pagebreak" title="572">572</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Program is that, with respect to any counsel with an Interest in the claims of any Enrolled Program Claimant, all other Eligible Claimants in which such counsel has an Interest shall be enrolled in the Program.” In the event a given client refused to participate, the signatory law firms promised, “to the extent permitted” by applicable strictures of legal ethics, “to disengage . . . from the representation” and “to forego any [i]nterest” in whatever recovery the client ultimately might obtain. Absent a signatory law firm’s commitment of its entire Vioxx client inventory to the deal, Merck would have the discretion to reject the firm’s enrollment such that none of the firm’s clients would be eligible to enroll.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Troubled by the above provisions, some plaintiffs’ counsel sought a declaratory judgment that these terms were unenforceable. In response, Merck and the negotiating plaintiffs’ lawyers added explanatory language to the agreement: “Each Enrolling Counsel is expected to exercise his or her independent judgment in the best interest of each client individually before determining whether to recommend enrollment in the Program.” This amendment, however, was put forth as a “clarification” rather than as a substantive change; the agreement’s controversial provisions were not removed.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To recap, the amended agreement contained the following five provisions:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Merck had the right to walk away from the settlement unless at least 85 percent of the plaintiffs agreed to it.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of each client.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When submitting an enrollment form, plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed that she had recommended the settlement to 100 percent of her clients. If a lawyer did not commit her entire client inventory to the settlement, Merck could reject the lawyer’s enrollment such that none of the lawyer’s clients would be eligible to enroll.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to “disengage” from representing clients who rejected the recommendation to settle, to the extent permitted under Rules 1.16 and 5.6(b).</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">(5)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If plaintiffs’ counsel withdrew from representing a particular client, she agreed to forgo any financial interests in that client’s ultimate recovery.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">However unorthodox, this was a way to reach a global settlement and stem the tide of litigation. On July 17, 2008, Merck formally announced that it was satisfied that the agreement’s 85 percent trigger would be met, and it deposited an initial sum of $500 million into the settlement fund, clearing the way for the distribution of initial payments. In fact, a full 99.9 percent of claims were ultimately resolved under the settlement program, making Vioxx (by one measure) the most successful mass tort settlement in American history. The payments went smoothly, </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page573" class="pagebreak" title="573">573</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">and by 2010, most claims had been paid.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Nevertheless, some condemned the Vioxx settlement for running roughshod over various rules of professional ethics in its quest for closure.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Lawyer-client business transactions gone wrong can become the subject of heated litigation. An aggrieved client may claim that, in entering into a </span>

        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;">business relationship, the lawyer breached a duty of loyalty, fidelity, and reasonable care. In these suits, some courts hold that if the lawyer and client have entered into a business transaction and the client subsequently challenges the transaction’s substantive fairness, the standard burdens of proof are flipped. In order to prevail, the client does not have to show overreach. Rather, the lawyer bears the burden of “establish[ing] that the transaction was fair and conducted in good faith.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;"> Indeed, some courts go further, requiring the lawyer to prove the transaction’s substantive fairness by “clear and convincing evidence.”</span>

This wrinkle came to the fore during the boom in internet and other high-technology companies in the late 1990s, as many prominent law firms pioneered fee arrangements in which cash-strapped entrepreneurs compensated lawyers with shares or investments in their start-up companies. This practice has proven controversial, both because it threatens to compromise lawyers’ independent judgment, and because as companies prosper, lawyers can make fortunes, raising questions about whether their fees are excessive pursuant to Rule 1.5(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.5(a)&quot; \s &quot;1.5(a)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>

You accept the offer. Some years later, after you have become a member of the board of directors and a large shareholder, the company becomes the target of a hostile takeover. A lucrative tender offer is likely to make you rich by boosting the value of your shares; a successful takeover could also deprive you of your job. In either case, are you capable of rendering independent legal judgment to the company? What should you do?</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A business conflict of a different sort arises when a lawyer agrees to represent a litigant in a sensational case in return for media rights to the story. In some instances, this is the only way that the client can afford the services of a highly qualified lawyer. Yet another specific conflicts rule, Rule 1.8(d), forbids the practice. It provides: “Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.” In justifying the restriction, Comment 9 to Rule 1.8 explains that the sale of such rights will create conflicts because “[m]easures suitable in the representation of the client may detract from the publication value of an account of the representation.”</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In a landmark decision, <a id="dabmci_91731be95d9540ae8f1570a8d9e45e0e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">Maxwell v. Superior Court</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">, 639 P.2d 248 (Cal. 1982)</span>, the California Supreme Court sidestepped the Rule 1.8(d) prohibition in the case of an indigent criminal defendant, Bobby Joe Maxwell, who was nicknamed the “Skid Row Stabber” and charged with ten counts of murder. Maxwell could not pay his lawyers. So his legal team, led by Los Angeles lawyer Pierpont M. Laidley, proposed a contract for the rights to Maxwell’s story in return for free representation. Anticipating an ethical challenge, the lawyers drew up a detailed nineteen-page contract that warned Maxwell of the myriad risks he was assuming by agreeing to the unconventional fee arrangement. These risks included that counsel’s economic motives might run counter to Maxwell’s best interest, that counsel might avoid mental defenses because, if successful, they might suggest Maxwell’s incapacity to make the contract, that counsel might want to sensationalize the trial, or that counsel may even want to sabotage the trial and see <a id="dabmci_c525e803fc104db08ae9317474682683" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Maxwell sentenced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page578" class="pagebreak" title="578">578</span>to death, as such a sentence might make for a more dramatic end to their story.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Subsequently, though, the trial court got wind of the agreement. After a hearing and over Maxwell’s protests, the court removed Laidley and his team, citing the impropriety of the fee arrangement. Maxwell appealed the trial court’s decision, and the case ultimately made its way to the California Supreme Court. </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, the California Supreme Court reinstated Laidley and his colleagues, holding that Maxwell had adequately waived any potential conflict and had a due process right to the counsel of his choice. Said the court: “When the possibility of significant conflict has been brought to the court’s attention and the danger of proceeding with chosen counsel has been disclosed generally to defendant, he may insist on retaining his attorneys if he waives the conflict knowingly and intelligently for purposes of the criminal trial.” </span>

Who’s going to read a book by a losing defense attorney? It’s absurd.” Laidley also insisted that such media deals are no more corrupting than other fee arrangements.

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> And some lawyers’ past exploitation of clients can read like a catalog of ignominy: In reported cases, attorneys have, among other things, threatened to withhold legal services unless clients acceded to the lawyers’ sexual advances,</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> and sent female clients unsolicited “sexts.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Further, even sexual relationships that are, on the surface, consensual often involve clients who are particularly vulnerable, including those who are victims of domestic violence, facing criminal charges, in the midst of marital dissolution, at risk of losing custody of their children, or are otherwise suffering from acute mental or emotional distress.</span>

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Few dispute that these sexual exploits are unethical. As one commentator notes: “It is hard not to be disgusted by lawyers who would turn their own clients into prostitutes.”</span>
        <a id="_Ref33608155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> But even so, a specific ban on attorney-client sexual relations is of relatively recent vintage. In 1992, California became the first state to establish a specific rule against attorney-client sexual relationships, and ten years later, in 2002, the ABA followed suit, adopting Model Rule 1.8(j)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.8(j)&quot; \s &quot;1.8(j)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">. It provides: “A lawyer shall not have sexual relations with a client unless a consensual sexual relationship existed between them when the client-lawyer relationship commenced.” Now, the majority of states have enacted Rule 1.8(j), or a similar provision.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1270" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1270" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">178</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Those justifying Rule 1.8(j) offer several explanations for its bright-line prohibition. Most obviously, the ban springs from an exploitation concern, and indeed, in the only Formal Opinion on the subject, the ABA identified several practice areas—including family law, criminal defense, probate, and immigration—where clients’ particular vulnerability might render it unlikely that the client could give adequate, genuine, informed consent to a sexual relationship.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1271" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1271" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">179</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, it is said that even if a sexual relationship </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">is</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> truly consensual, several problems might still arise. First, an intimate relationship may impair the lawyer’s independent judgment. Many </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page580" class="pagebreak" title="580">580</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">believe that “[e]motional detachment is essential to the lawyer’s ability to render competent legal service.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1272" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1272" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">180</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">It follows, then, that by threatening that “detachment,” the relationship might impair the lawyer’s judgment and competence.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1273" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1273" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">181</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> A corporate lawyer might, for example, counsel the client against settlement in order to prolong the representation. Or a family lawyer, involved in a relationship with a divorcing spouse, might counsel against marital reconciliation. Second, the relationship might chill attorney-client communication. Here, an attorney engaged in an intimate relationship with a client may be hesitant to disclose to the client unpalatable facts or potentially undesirable outcomes, out of fear that such disclosures might affect the relationship.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1274" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1274" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">182</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Finally, a blurred line between the professional and personal may compromise the attorney-client privilege. This is because, as Chapter 6 explains, the privilege only protects statements made in the context of bona fide client-lawyer communication; if an attorney and client share secrets as part of a personal relationship, those disclosures won’t necessarily be protected.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">per se</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> ban demeans female clients by assuming their vulnerability and incompetence and also deprives female lawyers of opportunities for relationships that pose little threat of coercion or impaired judgment.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Others question why the Model Rules impose a </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">per se</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> ban on sexual but not business relationships with clients, particularly since “none of the principles of behavioral economics would suggest that lawyers are more inclined to put their interests ahead of their clients in the personal rather than the financial realm.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Others maintain that Rule 1.8(j) is redundant and unnecessary because the rules, as written, already cover circumstances when the lawyer abuses the client’s trust.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1278" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section19.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1278" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">186</a>

        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Finally, still others charge that the Rule triggers “unwarranted complaints” by clients dissatisfied with a case’s outcome or by opposing parties seeking tactical advantages (though, to be fair, there is scant evidence of any such effect).</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Taking a hard line against Rule 1.8(j) and citing many of the above concerns, Texas rejected a proposed rule akin to Rule 1.8(j) in 2010. Indeed, three-quarters of voting lawyers cast their ballots against the restrictions.</span>

That sex may happen between consenting adults does not necessarily destroy relationships or breach fiduciary duties. Some will behave responsibly and others won’t. A bright line test may help prosecutors, but fails to take into consideration sexual relations that may occur without undue influence, without coercion, without drugs, without turmoil and without destroying the quality of an attorney-client relationship.</span>

For example, sophisticated corporate clients may not care if the law firm that represents them in a contract dispute with another company also represents that other company in unrelated corporate tax matters. For a critique of the rule preventing lawyers from being “directly adverse” to a client in a matter unrelated to one in which the client has engaged the lawyer, see Daniel J.

        <p style="margin-left: 16.55pt; margin-right: 16.55pt;" class="FNTextFlush">To compel the client to show, in addition to establishing that the subject of the present adverse representation is related to the former, the actual confidential matters previously entrusted to the attorney and their possible value to the present client would tear aside the protective cloak drawn about the lawyer-client relationship. For the Court to probe further and sift the confidences in fact revealed would require the disclosure of the very matters intended to be protected by the rule.</p>

Similarly, Comment 22 to Rule 1.7 provides that a client’s ability to consent to future conflicts “is generally determined by the extent to which the client reasonably understands the material risks that the waiver entails.” The Comment suggests that a waiver’s validity may turn on (1) the client’s familiarity with the type of conflict; (2) whether the consent is open-ended or specific; (3) the client’s sophistication and experience; and (4) whether the client is independently represented by counsel in giving consent.</p>

Although the dissent would allow simultaneous negotiations, it would require that “whatever fee the parties agree to” be “found by the court to be a ‘reasonable’ one under the Fees Act.” The dissent’s proposal is imaginative, but not very practical. Of the 10,757 “other civil rights” cases filed in federal court last year—most of which were <a id="dabmci_4102ba5f915d44f2a02122ee559ed0cf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />42 U.S.C. § 1983 actions for which § 1988 authorizes an award of fees—only 111 sought class relief. Assuming that of the approximately 99% of these civil rights actions that are not class actions, a further 90% would settle rather than go to trial, the dissent’s proposal would require district courts to evaluate the reasonableness of fee agreements in several thousand civil rights cases annually while they make that determination in slightly over 100 civil rights class actions now. Moreover, if this novel procedure really is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Fees Act, presumably it should be applied to all cases arising under federal statutes that provide for fee shifting.</p>

If this occurred, the pool of lawyers willing to represent plaintiffs in such cases might shrink, constricting the “effective access to the judicial process” for persons with civil rights grievances which the Fees Act was intended to provide. <a id="dabmci_813a6676bfe4459f92d6066d9bdc0e05" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.R.Rep. No. 94–1558, p. 1 (1976). That the “tyranny of small decisions” may operate in this fashion is not to say that there is any reason or documentation to support such a concern at the present time. Comment on this issue is therefore premature at this juncture. We believe, however, that as a practical matter the likelihood of this circumstance arising is remote.</p>
