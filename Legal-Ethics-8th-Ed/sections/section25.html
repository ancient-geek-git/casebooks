        <span style="color: #000000;">Today’s law students are acutely aware that the route to bar admission requires that they typically pass a grueling examination of legal doctrine and demonstrate their “moral fitness” to practice law. Although most law graduates in most jurisdictions jump over these hurdles, they impose significant financial and psychological costs and disproportionately exclude less privileged applicants. The moral character application for bar admission, in particular, can delay and deter applicants with prior offenses or mental health difficulties that bear little relationship to current fitness for practice. This chapter explores the origins and contemporary operation of the bar admission process, focusing on the justifications for the bar examination and moral character requirements and the tradeoffs they impose. The chapter also examines the challenge facing lawyers whose practice takes them outside of the state in which they have passed the bar. In an era of increasingly multijurisdictional practice, how should states treat lawyers whose client relationships require work outside the state where they are admitted? </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">For much of its history, the American bar made relatively little effort to ensure adequate qualifications among its members. As Chapter 3 noted, the courts traditionally asserted inherent power to regulate the practice of law, including authority to determine who could appear before them. However, until the twentieth century, formal admission standards were lax. Courts required applicants to demonstrate “fitness to practice” but generally that involved only perfunctory oral exams and/or some limited period of preparation. The absence of any legal degree requirement reflected both the inaccessibility and inadequacy of professional training in early universities and the legacy of English traditions. England placed responsibility for legal instruction under independent Inns of Court rather than academic institutions. Although some eighteenth-century Americans traveled to the Inns in England, the training they received there during this period was not extensive. Moreover, most practitioners who could afford neither study abroad nor enrollment in an American university prepared through apprenticeships.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">This system left much to be desired. The conventional arrangement was for aspiring attorneys to offer their services plus a fee to established lawyers in exchange for instruction and the right to use their masters’ </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">legal forms later in practice. In an era before typewriting, preprinted forms, and duplicating services, students often spent most of their apprenticeships copying writs and documents. Not only were such training experiences extremely tedious, they offered little chance for broader inquiry. All too often, the only opportunities for less technical instruction came through independent reading of treatises and other materials not intended as textbooks. Although a few law schools emerged in the late eighteenth century to supplement such instruction, they remained few in number and limited in scope until after the Civil War.</span>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, over most of our history there were no official standards of preparation for the bar, and such standards as existed in fact were largely the product of the schools’ traditions. . . . [By] 1860 only 9 of 39 states and territories had even nominal requirements of professional preparation. By 1890 nearly one half, by 1920 about three fourths, and by 1940 all states required some professional study preparatory to admission. The spread of this requirement was gradually attended by a lengthening of the period of professional preparation, up to the three-year requirement which by 1940 was fixed in forty states. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The examination was throughout the main official instrument for enforcing standards of preparation for the bar. Before 1870 it was typically oral. In any case, oral or written, it was administered with casual leniency; the approach was characteristic of times and communities that were close enough to the frontier so that they had no awe of formality or specialized knowledge, and small enough so that personal acquaintance and relationships were a substantial check on conduct. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Before 1890 only four states had boards of bar examiners, and in no more than half a dozen had written examinations been used. However, when the leading law schools began to use the written examination, this encouraged adoption of the practice in the states, where it became the invariable method of examination after 1900. . . . [However, surveys] showed that about 90 per cent of all who applied from 1922 to 1925 eventually passed. . . .</span>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although bar examinations have an extended history, their early forms bear little resemblance to their modern versions. Before the Civil War, exams were typically oral and were administered by state judges or attorneys appointed by the court on an ad hoc basis. The procedures governing these examinations were often quite informal, as the following description of an examination conducted by Abraham Lincoln suggests. The candidate, Jonathan Birch, encountered Lincoln in a hotel room, in the process of taking a bath, which continued during the interview. According to Birch:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[Lincoln] asked in a desultory way the definition of a contract, and two or three other fundamental questions, all of which I answered readily, and I thought, correctly. Beyond these meager inquiries, as I now recall the incident, he asked nothing more. Meanwhile, sitting on the edge of the bed he began to entertain me with recollections—many of them characteristically vivid and racy—of his own practice and the various incidents and adventures that attended his start in the profession. The whole proceeding was interesting yet so unusual, if not grotesque, that I was at a loss to determine whether I was really being examined or not.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2147" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a>

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Eventually, Lincoln sent Birch off with a note to the other member of the Springfield examining committee, who admitted him without further inquiry. The note read: “The bearer of this is a young man who thinks he can be a lawyer. Examine him if you want to. I have done so and am satisfied. He’s a good deal smarter than he looks to be. Yours, Lincoln.”</span>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In the late nineteenth century, states attempted to upgrade standards by establishing boards of bar examiners and requiring written exams. However, most early examiners were part-time or short-term employees, with limited expertise. The tests they devised usually demanded only rote learning and basic literacy—and all but a small minority of candidates ultimately passed.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Moreover, in many jurisdictions, a major impetus for screening candidates was not competence </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">per se,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> but public image. Elite members of the bar often saw examinations as a means of stemming the tide of lower-class applicants, </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page950" class="pagebreak" title="950">950</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">particularly religious and ethnic minorities, whose inadequate command of the “King’s English” threatened to debase the profession’s status.</span>

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In 1931, a National Conference of Bar Examiners was created to upgrade standards, as well as to promote cooperation among the states. Partly as a result of Conference efforts, examinations over the next half century became more uniform and comprehensive. The development of a multistate multiple choice test in core subjects reflected and accelerated this trend. Yet whether this trend is to be welcomed, and whether bar exams in their current form are an appropriate means of assessing competence, remain matters of considerable dispute.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The bar examination has often been challenged on both legal and policy grounds. Courts have rejected constitutional claims based on racially disparate impact and on the arbitrariness of grading standards.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2151" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2151" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a>

        <span style="color: #000000;">, 540 F.2d 744 (4th Cir. 1976)</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the South Carolina Bar exam on grounds that it disproportionately excluded black applicants and was not demonstrably job related. At trial, the evidence of the exam’s validity consisted of testimony by individual bar examiners that they were successful practitioners and that they believed that the questions were relevant to the applicant’s competence to practice law, and that bar exam performance correlated with law school grades. Evidence was also introduced to validate the grading system, which for some examiners consisted of their overall assessment of the exam, and assignment of a single numerical grade, with seventy as a passing score. Other examiners assigned points to particular parts of questions and compiled those points. The court conceded the subjectivity of the system but did not find it so “unrelated to the State’s objectives as to violate the Equal Protection Clause.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2152" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Despite such holdings, criticism of bar exams persists on several levels.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The most fundamental objection is that the capabilities that exams measure do not assess most of the skills necessary for competent practice. Standardized testing places a high premium on rote memorization and the ability to function under extreme time pressure. Most exams assess only a few of the essential core competencies identified by the ABA’s blue ribbon (MacCrate) Commission on Law Schools and the Profession: legal </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page951" class="pagebreak" title="951">951</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">analysis and reasoning, legal research, factual investigation, communication, counseling, negotiation, litigation and dispute resolution procedures, organization and management of legal work, and recognizing and resolving ethical issues.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2153" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Although most states have made some effort to supplement standard multiple choice and essay questions with some skills assessment, and the Multistate exam includes a performance component, the exam still focuses on mastery of general doctrine. As the MacCrate Commission noted:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[T]he traditional bar exam does nothing to encourage law schools to teach and law students to acquire many of the fundamental lawyering skills. . . . [If anything,] the examination influences law schools, in developing their curricula, to overemphasize courses in the substantive areas covered by the examination at the expense of courses in the area of lawyering skills.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2154" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2154" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Reports by the Conference of Chief Justices and the Society of American Law Teachers have come to similar conclusions.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2155" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The problem is compounded by pressure that law faculty often feel to teach to the test, rather than to focus on material that would ultimately prove more valuable.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The result, according to critics, is to encourage a superficial knowledge of selective fields, which creates a false sense of complacency among successful applicants and the general public.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2156" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> As James Moliterno argues, the “current typical bar exam tests too much and too little.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2157" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2157" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">It requires too much memorization of doctrine from too many legal fields, while failing to assess applicants’ practical skills. Much of the information memorized will be forgotten after the exam or will be irrelevant to the contexts in which applicants practice.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2158" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2158" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Others point out that this screening method is also both over- and under-inclusive. The current admission requirements exclude individuals with experience and practice skills who could provide assistance for routine needs, while providing no assurance that those who pass law school and bar exams are, or will remain, competent in their chosen fields of specialty.</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page952" class="pagebreak" title="952">952</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">An additional problem, according to critics, involves the arbitrariness of grading procedures and their adverse impact on diversity in the profession. As Deborah Rhode has observed:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although bar exams do measure some relevant skills, the current grading system does not capture relevant distinctions. No effort has been made to correlate performance on admission exams with performance in practice. The most that bar officials can establish is a correlation between examination scores and law school grades. That relationship is scarcely surprising, since both measure similar skills. How well either predicts success as a lawyer is something else again, and has yet to be demonstrated.

        <span style="color: #000000;">The inadequate link between exam and job performance is of special concern because minority applicants have disproportionately low passage rates. Part of the problem is that these applicants are least able to afford the time and expense of bar review courses and multiple attempts at passing. Although courts have rejected claims that the exam process is racially discriminatory and insufficiently predictive of competence in practice, their reasoning has relied on evidence that they have found deficient in other occupational contexts: unsupported testimony by administrators who believe that their questions are unbiased and relevant. But even assuming that exam performance demonstrates some necessary lawyering skills, the current grading process is arbitrary at best. One California study found that a third of bar examiners disagreed about whether a particular set of answers failed or passed, and that a quarter of examiners, when presented with the same paper a second time, reversed their earlier decision.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">The selection of passing scores raises further difficulties. States that use the same multiple choice tests vary considerably in their selection of passing scores and in their ratios of successful to unsuccessful applicants. The percentage of candidates who pass ranges from the 30s to the 90s. Unsurprisingly, success rates tend to be lowest in the states with the greatest concentrations of lawyers, where new competitors are particularly unwelcome. By contrast, other jurisdictions pass . . . a high proportion of candidates. . . . No evidence suggest that these states experience exceptional problems with lawyer performance. If states swapped cut-off scores, the majority of applicants passing the bar in permissive jurisdictions would fail, and the majority of those failing in stringent jurisdictions would pass. So too, as statisticians point </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">out, higher grading standards do not guarantee higher competence in a system where about 95 percent of candidates who keep taking the exam eventually pass. In states with low success rates, students simply “study harder” and more applicants have to take the test multiple times.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Although most states do not collect statistics on the race of successful and unsuccessful bar applicants, those that do have found substantial racial and ethnic differences, as did the only national study. That survey by the Law School Admission Council reported eventual bar exam pass rates of 78 percent for African-Americans and 96 percent for white applicants; the rates for other minority racial and ethnic groups were 8 to 15 percent lower than for white test takers. So too, a higher proportion of African-Americans than whites who fail the first time do not take the test again: 11 percent versus 2 percent.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The reasons for these differential success rates are not entirely clear, but many experts believe that the extent of the variance does not reflect underlying competence.

        <span style="color: #000000;">, an unsuccessful bar applicant claimed that the Board’s practice of setting passing scores after exams were graded constituted an anticompetitive effort to limit the number of licensed attorneys and thus violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The United States Supreme Court rejected that claim. Under the majority’s analysis, the administration of bar admission procedures occurred under Arizona Supreme Court auspices and therefore fell within the Act’s state action exemption. However, the majority also acknowledged the subjectivity involved in the choice of passing grades: “By its very nature, therefore, </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">grading examinations does not necessarily separate the competent from the incompetent or—except very roughly—identify those qualified to practice and those not qualified.

        <span style="color: #000000;">A final criticism of the current testing system involves its other costs. These include the time and effort spent on bar review cram courses, the inhibition of interest in law school work that does not aid exam preparation, and the barriers to practitioners’ mobility across state lines.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> If the bar exam system is justifiable despite these costs because it measures basic competence, critics question why graduation from an accredited school is also required. Conversely, if the test does not adequately screen for competence, why require it in addition to law school?</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In response, defenders of bar exams advance several arguments. First, they defend the test as a relatively inexpensive way to make standardized anonymous evaluations of basic legal knowledge. It also provides an incentive for students to synthesize information, to familiarize themselves with local law, to improve writing and analytic skills, and to recognize legal issues in areas outside their expected specialty.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2167" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> As one examiner put it: “By ensuring that candidates admitted to practice have achieved a reasonable level of competence in applying professional skills to commonly encountered practice problems, the bar examination requirement and educational requirement are expected to control one threat to the overall quality of practice—the threat posed by practitioners who lack basic competencies.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2168" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2168" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a>

        <span style="color: #000000;">extent that current bar exams do not promote a useful learning experience, defenders wish to improve, not eliminate, testing procedures.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Second, defenders insist that if the bar exam were discarded, the likely alternative would be worse. Assessments relying on personal demonstration of practice skills increase expense, inconsistency, and the potential for bias. Alternatively, a diploma privilege admitting all graduates of ABA-approved law schools might lead to more interference with those schools’ curricular offerings, or graduation and admission requirements. Given faculty members’ disinclination to fail students, elimination of the bar exam might leave no significant screening device for minimal competence.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> It may, in part, be these concerns, together with a sense of hard-won entitlement among admitted practitioners, that have blocked impetus for significant change.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Robert Fellmeth, a Professor of Public Interest Law, consumer advocate, and former independent monitor of the California Disciplinary System, has delivered a blistering critique of the California bar exam.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> His critique raises four principal concerns. First, the bar exam, unlike the entry exam of every other California agency, has not been job validated. Second, recent passage rates are lower than that of all but one other state and are about half the level of most other major states, including New York. Nearly seven in ten applicants failed the February 2019 exam.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Third, the exam tests only current knowledge, unlike other exams, including medical licensing tests, which must be retaken at stated intervals. Finally, the state supreme court has relied too much on “market practitioners” instead of engaging in the “active supervision” required by antitrust doctrine to insulate anticompetitive activities from liability. </span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> A few have expanded their reciprocal admission procedures to waive exam and other requirements for lawyers from states that extend the same waivers to others with comparable provisions. One recommendation, by a Tri-State Task Force of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont bar leaders and educators, would replace the bar exam with a comprehensive educational program designed to improve lawyer competence through in-depth skills training and evaluation.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">Some commentators have also proposed licensing systems modeled on those in other countries or other professions.

        <span style="color: #000000;"> In most countries, legal education occurs at the undergraduate level, supplemented by a skills courses and an apprenticeship. For example, in Great Britain, after an undergraduate law degree (or a one-year intensive course in the foundations of legal knowledge), students must either complete a one-year legal practice course for solicitors or a bar vocational course for barristers, and then work under the supervision of a barrister for a one-year pupilage, or under a solicitor for a two-year training contract. Australian practitioners complete an extended undergraduate law degree and a two-year apprenticeship. Scotland requires a twenty-eight-month vocational course and a two-year traineeship. In Germany, students complete two years of theoretical study and an eighteen-month internship with a court, prosecutor, agency or private practitioner.

The Conference of Chief Justices of State Supreme Courts passed a similar resolution in 2010. Thirty-six states and territories have adopted the uniform exam, which allows aspiring lawyers to transfer scores among jurisdictions. However, states remain free to add exam questions, impose additional requirements, set their state’s passing score, and decide how long an applicant’s score remains valid.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Moral character as a professional credential has an extended history. For lawyers, the requirement dates to ancient Rome, and its Anglo-American roots reach to thirteenth-century England. In this country, every state bar currently makes certification of character a prerequisite for practice, and most other nations and licensed professions impose a similar mandate. In principle, the requirement’s rationale is straightforward: It serves both to protect the public from unethical practitioners, and to preserve confidence in the integrity of the system. In practice, however, the application of the standard has proven problematic. Historically, it has served to exclude a diverse and changing constituency, variously defined to include not only former felons, but religious, racial, and ethnic minorities, adulterers, political radicals, and </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page958" class="pagebreak" title="958">958</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">bankrupts. In perhaps the high-water mark of exclusivity, one Pennsylvania board rejected candidates deemed “dull,” “colorless,” “subnormal,” “unprepossessing,” “shifty,” “smooth,” “keen,” “shrewd,” “arrogant,” “conceited,” “surly,” and “slovenly.” Also rejected were those who lacked “well defined ideas on religion,” or had family members with “unsavory” backgrounds or a “poor business reputation.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">There is no profession in which moral character is so soon fixed as in that of the law; there is none in which it is subjected to severer scrutiny by the public. It is well that it is so. The things we hold dearest on earth—our fortunes, reputations, domestic peace, the future of those dearest to us, nay, our liberty and life itself—we confide to the integrity of our legal counselors and advocates. Their character must be not only without a stain, but without suspicion.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">One does not have to inhale the self-adulatory bombast of after-dinner speeches to affirm that all the interests of man that are comprised under the constitutional guarantees given to “life, liberty and property” are in the professional keeping of lawyers. It is a fair characterization of the lawyer’s responsibility in our society that he stands “as a shield,” to quote Devlin, J., in defense of right and to ward off wrong. From a profession charged with such responsibilities there must be exacted those qualities of truth-speaking, of a high sense of honor, of granite discretion, of the strictest observance of fiduciary responsibility, that have, throughout the centuries, been compendiously described as “moral character.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">It is beyond this Court’s function to act as overseer of a particular result of the procedure established by a particular State for admission to its bar. No doubt satisfaction of the requirement of moral character involves an exercise of delicate judgment on the part of those who reach a conclusion, having heard and seen the applicant for admission, a judgment of which it may be said as it was of “many honest and sensible judgments” in a different context that it expresses “an intuition of experience which outruns analysis and sums up many unnamed and tangled impressions,—impressions which may lie beneath consciousness without losing their worth.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">But judicial action, even in an individual case, may have been based on avowed considerations that are inadmissible in that they violate the requirements of due process. Refusal to allow a man to qualify himself for the profession on a wholly arbitrary standard or on a consideration that offends the dictates of reason offends the Due Process Clause. Such is the case here. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">To hold, as the [lower] court did, that Communist affiliation for six to seven years up to 1940, fifteen years prior to the court’s assessment of it, in and of itself made the petitioner “a person of questionable character” is so dogmatic an inference as to be wholly unwarranted. History overwhelmingly establishes that many youths like the petitioner were drawn by the mirage of communism during the depression era, only to have their eyes later opened to reality. Such experiences no doubt may disclose a woolly mind or naive notions regarding the problems of society. But facts of history that we would be arbitrary in rejecting bar the presumption, let alone an irrebuttable presumption, that response to foolish, baseless hopes regarding the betterment of society made those who had entertained them but who later undoubtedly came to their senses and their sense of responsibility “questionable characters.” Since the Supreme Court of New Mexico as a matter of law took a contrary view of such a situation in denying petitioner’s application, it denied him due process of law.</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Stephen Randall Glass made himself infamous as a dishonest journalist by fabricating material for more than 40 articles for </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">magazine and other publications. He also carefully fabricated supporting materials to delude </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> fact checkers. The articles appeared between June 1996 and May 1998, and included falsehoods that reflected negatively on individuals, political groups, and ethnic minorities. During the same period, starting in September 1997, he was also an evening law student at Georgetown University’s law school. Glass made every effort to avoid detection once suspicions were aroused, lobbied strenuously to keep his job at </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, and, in the aftermath of his exposure, did not fully cooperate with the publications to identify his fabrications.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass applied to become a member of the New York bar in 2002, but withdrew his application after he was informally notified in 2004 that his moral character application would be rejected. In the New York bar application materials, he exaggerated his cooperation with the journals that had published his work and failed to supply a complete list of the fabricated articles that had injured others.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass passed the California Bar examination in 2006 and filed an application for determination of moral character in 2007. It was not until the California State Bar moral character proceedings that Glass reviewed all of his articles, as well as the editorials </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> and other journals published to identify his fabrications, and ultimately identified fabrications that he previously had denied or failed to disclose. In the California proceedings, Glass was not forthright in acknowledging the defects in his New York bar application.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">At the 2010 State Bar Court hearing resulting in the decision under review, Glass presented many character witnesses and introduced evidence regarding his lengthy course of psychotherapy, along with his own testimony and other evidence. Many of his efforts from the time of his exposure in 1998 until the 2010 hearing, however, seem to have been directed primarily at advancing his own well-being rather than returning something to the community. His evidence did not establish that he engaged in truly exemplary conduct over an extended period. We conclude that on this record he has not sustained his heavy burden of demonstrating rehabilitation and fitness for the practice of law.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In September 1995 Glass accepted a position at </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">magazine. In early June 1996 he began fabricating material for publication. The fabrications continued and became bolder and more comprehensive until he was exposed and fired in May 1998. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass graduated from law school in 2000, when he also took and passed the New York bar examination. He applied to become a member of the New York bar in 2002. After an evidentiary hearing before a subcommittee of a committee on character and fitness, and pursuant to apparent custom, in September 2004, a representative of that committee informed Glass informally that his application would be rejected, so he withdrew it. The record does not disclose the reason for the tentative decision.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In his application to the New York bar, Glass described his misconduct and firing. His application and supporting materials included only 20 articles containing fabrications. Glass wrote that he had apologized to the editor of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> saying “I also worked with all three magazines [(referring to </span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">At the hearing, Lane [the editor of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">] challenged the quoted statement as untrue. Lane believed that Glass had failed to come forward to actively assist </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> in identifying his fabrications, and instead had placed the entire burden of identifying his errors on Lane. Lane testified: “Well, he didn’t work with us. The effort we went through, over the course of nearly a month, to investigate all those stories would have been unnecessary if he had worked with us, and simply come forward and laid bare everything that was untrue in his stories. Instead, he sought legal counsel and, in effect, clammed up. . . .”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">According to Glass, during his childhood and young adulthood his parents exerted extremely intense and cruel pressure upon him to succeed academically and socially. Glass felt that </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> offered an extremely competitive atmosphere and that his journalistic efforts there failed to make a mark sufficient to ensure his retention after his year term had elapsed. It was after a visit to the family home, when his parents berated him for his apparent failure even in what they considered the worthless career of journalism, that he began fabricating material for publication. He also fabricated reporter’s notes and supporting materials for his articles. His aim was to impress his parents and colleagues.</span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">, Glass was distraught, suicidal, and unable to focus, almost immediately entering therapy. He nonetheless hired counsel whom he directed to “work with </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">.” Glass testified that he believed that </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> wanted to conduct its own investigation because it did not trust him and testified that “I came to understand that they were going to provide me with a list of [fabricated] articles, and that I was to affirm whether or not the article was fabricated that they showed me or that they listed.” He had fabricated more than </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> had discovered in its investigation, although he testified that due to his distress he did not realize this when he reviewed the list or later when he glanced at </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic’s</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> editorials listing his fabrications. Four of his articles containing fabrications were not on the list. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass did well in law school. . . . Members of Georgetown University’s law school faculty testified on his behalf at the hearing. Professor Susan Bloch telephoned him when the scandal first broke and asked if he needed someone to talk to. She appointed him as her research assistant, praising him as one of the brightest and best workers she ever had encountered. She found him to be honest and developed complete trust in him. She recommended him for a judicial internship during law school and a clerkship after graduation. Bloch maintained friendly contact with Glass over the years, including after he moved to California, and testified on his behalf when Glass applied for admission to the New York bar. She testified that she believed Glass had learned from his wrongdoing, that the trauma of his exposure would keep him from ever repeating such behavior, and that she had never observed any dishonesty on his part. She did not read his fabricated articles but was generally aware of their content. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass testified that he moved to California in the fall of 2004. He was hired by the Carpenter, Zuckerman and Rowley law firm as a law clerk. The firm has many homeless clients, and in addition to the legal work he does on their cases, he has helped them with their personal problems. . . .

        <span style="color: #000000;">California attorney Paul Zuckerman testified that he decided to give Glass a chance as a law clerk. After initially assigning Glass minor projects and exercising close oversight, Zuckerman became convinced that Glass was one of the best employees in the firm, with a fine intellect, a good work ethic, and reliable commitment to honesty. Glass exhibited great compassion, assisting at a personal level with difficult clients and helping to find resources and social services for some of the firm’s many homeless clients. Other lawyers who had worked for or with the firm confirmed Zuckerman’s view of Glass as an employee who conducted excellent legal research, was assiduous and hyper-scrupulous about honesty, and stopped to think about ethical issues.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Also offered in support of Glass’s application were affidavits that had been submitted in support of his New York bar application from the judges for whom Glass had worked during and immediately after completing law school. Both found him highly competent and honest at that time. Additional declarations from attorneys and friends that had been submitted with the New York bar application were offered in support.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist, testified that he had treated Glass since 2005, and believed he had developed good judgment, scrupulous honesty, and the ability to handle difficult situations well. Dr. Friedman reported that he would be astonished if Glass committed misconduct as he had in the past, both because of the growth of character and moral sense the doctor had observed, but also because of a strong instinct to protect himself from the traumatic results of his prior misconduct. He reported that Glass had no sociopathic personality traits.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Richard Rosenthal, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who is known for treating gamblers and those with impulse control disorders, was approached by Glass’s attorney in 2005. Rosenthal had an evaluative as well as therapeutic relationship with Glass that began in 2005 and continued with meetings once or twice a month until the time of the hearing.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Dr. Rosenthal identified Glass’s underlying psychological issues as a need for approval, a need to impress others, and a need for attention, and pointed also to Glass’s fear of inadequacy, rejection, and abandonment. Rosenthal testified that when they met in 2005, Glass needed to overcome enormous shame and learn to forgive himself. Through therapy, Glass learned to be realistic about family issues and to set boundaries. Rosenthal believed that Glass had grown up in a family that exerted tremendous pressure on him to succeed yet always made him feel like a failure. In Rosenthal’s opinion, Glass was rehabilitated, meaning that he was extremely conscientious and honest, avoided the appearance of impropriety, had reasonable goals and expectations, had gained empathy and tolerance, and would not allow himself to be overwhelmed by stress. The doctor saw no evidence that Glass was a sociopath.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass himself described his therapy, which had commenced very shortly after his exposure and continued to the time of the 2010 hearing, that is, for 12 years. Through therapy he had learned to separate his feelings about his family from the work environment and to “set boundaries within my family.” He testified that he believed the most important thing he could do to make amends was to change himself.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Martin Peretz, who owned and managed </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">at the time of the fabrications, testified on Glass’s behalf and had developed a charitable view of his misconduct by the time of the California State Bar hearing. He blamed himself and, even more, the magazine’s editors for encouraging Glass to write zany, shocking articles and for failing to recognize the improbability of some of Glass’s stories. He found the harm </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page964" class="pagebreak" title="964">964</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">of the scandal to the magazine to be minimal. He had renewed social contact with Glass in the past few years and believed that Glass had been harshly treated. He would not rule out hiring Glass again as a journalist. He explained that in his experience as a professor “[t]he most brilliant students plagiarize,” complaining to the Committee’s counsel, “I actually find your pursuing him an act of stalking.” . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass took and passed the California Bar examination in 2006 and in July 2007 filed an application for determination of moral character as part of his bar application. The Committee of Bar Examiners denied the application, but on Glass’s request a moral character hearing was conducted in the State Bar Court in April and May of 2010.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The State Bar Court’s hearing judge found that Glass had established good moral character. The Committee sought review. The State Bar Court Review Department (Review Department) independently reviewed the record and a majority of the three-judge panel agreed with the hearing judge that Glass had established good moral character.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Review Department majority acknowledged that Glass’s misconduct had been “appalling” and “egregious,” but believed that Glass had satisfied his “heavy burden of proof” and established his rehabilitation. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">[We disagree.] Glass not only spent two years producing damaging articles containing or entirely made up of fabrications, thereby deluding the public, maligning individuals, and disparaging ethnic minorities, he also routinely expended considerable efforts to fabricate background materials to dupe the fact checkers assigned to vet his work. When exposure threatened, he redoubled his efforts to hide his misconduct, going so far as to create a phony Web site and business cards and to recruit his brother to pose as a source. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The record also discloses instances of dishonesty and disingenuousness occurring after Glass’s exposure, up to and including the State Bar evidentiary hearing in 2010. In the New York bar proceedings that ended in 2004, as even the State Bar Court majority acknowledged, he made misrepresentations concerning his cooperation with </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The New Republic</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> and other publications and efforts to aid them identify all of his fabrications. He also submitted an incomplete list of articles that injured others. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The record of Glass’s therapy does not represent “truly exemplary conduct in the sense of returning something to the community.” . . . To be sure, through therapy he seems to have gained a deep understanding of the psychological sources of his misconduct, as well as tools to help him avoid succumbing to the same pressures again. His treating psychiatrists are plainly highly competent and well regarded in their field, and they are convinced that he has no remaining psychological flaws tending to cause him to act dishonestly. Glass believed that he could best make </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page965" class="pagebreak" title="965">965</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">amends by changing himself. But his 12 years of therapy primarily conferred a personal benefit on Glass himself.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass points to the pro bono legal work he does for clients of his firm as evidence of sustained efforts on behalf of the community, but we observe that pro bono work is not truly </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">exemplary</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> for attorneys, but rather is expected of them.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Glass and the witnesses who supported his application stress his talent in the law and his commitment to the profession, and they argue that he has already paid a high enough price for his misdeeds to warrant admission to the bar. They emphasize his personal redemption, but we must recall that what is at stake is not compassion for Glass, who wishes to advance from being a supervised law clerk to enjoying a license to engage in the practice of law on an independent basis. Given our duty to protect the public and maintain the integrity and high standards of the profession . . . our focus is on the applicant’s moral fitness to practice law. On this record, the applicant failed to carry his heavy burden of establishing his rehabilitation and current fitness.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">For the foregoing reasons, we reject the State Bar Court majority’s recommendation and decline to admit Glass to the practice of law.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some charge that the expansiveness of this list and the subjectivity of its standards raise several concerns. One is the possibility for overly intrusive inquiries and inconsistent decisions. Historically, character committees have excluded individuals for a wide range of conduct that had little obvious relation to protection of the public, including everything from civil disobedience to cohabitation. Bar examiners and judges have often disagreed about the relative weight to be accorded to factors such as the severity or recency of the conduct, and the evidence of rehabilitation and remorse. So, for example, violation of a fishing license statute ten years earlier was sufficient to cause one local Michigan committee to decline certification. But, in the same state at about the same time, other examiners sitting on the central board admitted individuals convicted of child molestation and conspiring to bomb a public building. While Michigan’s repentant bomber gained admission despite years in a maximum security facility, an unconfessed Peeping Tom in Georgia was viewed as too great a threat to warrant admission.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2186" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Some evidence also suggests that race and class bias may affect the evaluation process.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> How substantial are these concerns?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some also complain about the timing of character inquiries—arguing that the current screening process comes both too early and too late. These critics point out that character inquiries occur before most applicants have faced situational pressures comparable to those in practice, but after candidates have made such a significant investment in legal training that denying admission imposes enormous costs. Do you agree? When should character inquiries come?</span>
      </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page967" class="pagebreak" title="967">967</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Others complain about the double standard operating in admission and disciplinary proceedings, as courts and bar authorities are far more willing to deny than to revoke a license based on evidence of misconduct. Recall, as Chapter 3, Section E indicates, disbarment is exceedingly rare and occurs in only the most egregious cases; disciplinary authorities generally do not even inquire into the kind of minor financial and misdemeanor conduct that can result in delay or denials for applicants. Is this double standard justified? Some argue that, from the standpoint of protecting the public, misconduct is most probative of threats to clients when it is committed by individuals who are already officers of the court. If matters such as financial irresponsibility, mental health disabilities, or disregard of legal obligations like child support awards can justify exclusion from practice, why do they trigger inquiry only by admission and not disciplinary bodies?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A difficulty with character screening involves problems of predicting future misconduct from prior acts that occur under quite different circumstances. Psychological research makes clear that moral behavior is highly situational, and that contextual norms, incentives, and pressures have a substantial impact on ethical conduct.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2188" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2188" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Past conduct is, of course, relevant in assessing how people will react to such contextual influences. Yet it is often necessary to know a good deal about why individuals responded to earlier situations in order to predict how they will react in different future circumstances.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2189" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2189" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Bar examiners frequently lack that level of knowledge.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A recent review of 1343 Connecticut bar applicants and their subsequent disciplinary records found that, although some factors do increase the likelihood of discipline, even these factors are poor predictors. As the authors explain, “even if some variable (e.g., having defaulted on a student loan) doubles the likelihood of subsequent disciplinary action—a very strong effect—the probability of subsequent discipline for an applicant with a student loan default is still only 5 percent.”</span>

Taking all the risk factors together, “only two individuals were predicted to have a better than even chance of being disciplined, a finding that casts serious doubt on the usefulness of the character and fitness inquiry as a predictor of lawyer misconduct.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">In February 2008, the ABA approved a Model Rule on Conditional Admission for applicants who demonstrate “recent rehabilitation from dependency or successful treatment for mental or other illness, or from any other condition that the court deems appropriate that has resulted in conduct or behavior that would otherwise have rendered the applicant currently unfit to practice law.”</span>

        </span>

        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> The report pointed out that some 70 million Americans, about a fifth of the population, have criminal records that could trigger moral character inquiries or denials by state bars. A disproportionate number of those individuals are people of color.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> States differ in how they treat applicants with serious criminal records. Some permanently exclude felons. Many, like California, have a rebuttable presumption against admitting applicants convicted of certain crimes. (California, for instance, specifies violent felonies, felonies involving moral turpitude, and crimes involving a breach of fiduciary duty.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">More broadly, the report found that the process of admission lacks transparency. The bar releases no information about denials, so applicants have little basis for evaluating their chances of admission. The result is to deter many candidates with criminal records from applying to law school. The Centers’ survey of potential applicants with such records revealed the following:</span>

The Washington Board of Bar Examiners denied her application to sit for the bar exam on the ground that her most recent misconduct was only six years ago, her rehabilitation was still “fragile” and “untested,” her fame had given her a disturbing “sense of entitlement,” and she had “not yet established an overall consistent and permanent pattern of positive conduct sufficient to outweigh her years of misconduct.” How should the Supreme Court rule? </p>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">In 1977, Lee King was employed as a deputy constable in Texas. While depressed and drunk, he shot two unarmed men after a fight in a bar. He pled guilty to attempted murder, and served four months before a court suspended his sentence. He then graduated from college and law school, and was admitted to the Texas bar. He married, completed alcohol counseling, practiced in Texas, and after ten years moved to Arizona to work in his firm’s Phoenix office. Although the Arizona character committee recommended his admission, the Supreme Court disagreed. In the majority’s view, King had not made the “ ‘virtually impossible’ showing needed to erase the stain of his serious misconduct.” What most disturbed the court was King’s suggestion that he might have had a defense to the charges of attempted murder, but that he had accepted the plea because of “anti-police” public attitudes, which might have compromised his ability to get a fair trial. Because King did not adequately show why he committed the attempted murders or how he had overcome his weakness, he had not met his high burden of proof.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

He had never been diagnosed as having a mental health disability warranting further treatment, and in the dissent’s view, he should not have been penalized for failing to obtain a mental health expert to diagnose his earlier character flaw trait and his “triumph over it.” The dissenting judge also questioned whether applicants would be better served by a bright line rule barring admission of those with serious offenses, because “if Mr. King’s application cannot meet our ‘non per se’ standards, I doubt that any ever will.” Is he right? </span>

He also admitted inappropriate sexual conduct with nine other students between the ages of 13 and 17, including kissing and sexual intercourse. While serving four years in prison, he completed sexual offender counseling and was, “by all accounts, a model prisoner.” He subsequently married, graduated from law school, and found employment working as a nonlawyer in a law firm. In recommending against admission, the state character committee described his demeanor as “too articulate, glib, and adept at explaining away his past behavior.” The court accepted that recommendation, noting that attorneys enjoy great trust and confidence from clients and the applicant “failed to convince us that, given the opportunity, he would not breach such trust and confidence.” Do you agree? Should it matter that there is no evidence that outward displays of repentance accurately reflect “character” or predict a lower likelihood of recidivism?</span>

While serving his sentence, he obtained a college degree summa cum laude and married a woman with whom he formed a prison reform organization. After his sentence was commuted, he performed thousands of hours of community service and graduated from the University of Arizona law school. Some state legislators were outraged by his admission. By threatening budget cuts, they forced the law school to review its policy concerning convicted felons. According to the president of the state senate, “Hamm’s precious seat should go to one of the thousands of applicants who didn’t shoot somebody in the head.” Defenders of Hamm’s admission argued that he should have the right, once he had served his sentence, to put the crime behind him. Hamm himself maintained that “I don’t want to put it behind </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">After passing the bar exam and working for several years as Director of Advocacy Services at the prison reform organization, he sought admission to practice. In denying his application, the Arizona Supreme Court cited several factors. One was his failure to make any child support payments to the son he had fathered in 1969 until after he applied to the bar in 2004. Although Hamm attempted to excuse his failure by claiming that he had learned in 1988 that his son had been adopted by his former wife’s husband, that did not, in the court’s view, explain his lack of concern prior to 1988. Nor was Hamm’s account consistent with his son’s testimony that he had never told his father that he had been adopted. The Committee was also disturbed by Hamm’s failure to disclose an altercation with his wife that had caused a call to the police (but no arrest) in 1996, and his use of language in his petition for review from a prior supreme court decision without quotes or attribution. Are these sufficient basis to deny admission? </span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Four different students at four different law schools were found to have plagiarized papers off the internet during their final year. One school simply gave the student an F in the course; a second suspended the student for a year; a third agreed not to report the conduct to the bar if the student performed 100 hours of community service; and the fourth learned of the plagiarism only after the student graduated, when a journal to which the paper was submitted discovered the earlier publication. What are the obligations of the law schools and the applicants to report these incidents? Should bar examiners’ response be affected by the severity of the school’s response? Is one act of plagiarism sufficient grounds for exclusion? If, as some studies suggest, law schools experience a high incidence of unreported academic misconduct, what follows from that fact? How should bar examiners respond to conduct such as providing false information on a law school application or falsifying a resume and transcript? Should applicants be given clear guidance about how such acts will be treated?</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Bar Commission of Nebraska denied Paul Converse the right to sit for the state bar exam based on his history of repeated conflicts with administrators at the University of South Dakota Law School. The conflicts included a series of complaints about grades, internship procedures, parking violations, removal of a photograph of a female nude posted in his law school carrel, and marketing of a “Deanie on a Weanie” shirt depicting a nude caricature of the dean astride a large hot dog with a caption reading “astride the Peter Principle.” Converse drew attention to many of these conflicts by circulating letters rather than relying on prescribed complaint channels. He sent correspondence to the judges of the South Dakota Supreme Court in the grade dispute, to the ACLU in the library carrel incident, and to the school newspaper in other matters. He also threatened litigation and contacted the university president to demand that the dean be fired for incompetence. Prior to law school, Converse sued a tenant for nonpayment of rent and referred to her as a “fucking welfare bitch.”</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">

In 2008, the applicant graduated from The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law (at the age of thirty-eight) owing “approximately $170,000 in student loans—$20,000 for his undergraduate studies and $150,000 for law school. He also had incurred approximately $16,500 in credit-card debt.” In upholding his rejection, the court accepted “the board’s findings of fact and conclude that the applicant has neglected his personal financial obligations by electing to maintain his part-time employment with the Public Defender’s Office in the hope that it will lead to a full-time position upon passage of the bar exam, rather than seeking full-time employment, which he acknowledges would give him a better opportunity to pay his obligations and possibly qualify him for an additional deferment of his student-loan obligation.”</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How effectively does the ABA’s Model Rule on Conditional Admission to Practice Law deal with the problematic issues raised by bar inquiries into mental health? One study finds that conditional admission is often used for applicants with mental health or substance abuse histories who are not currently impaired and who would have been licensed under the pre-2008 standard. The result, the study’s authors argue, is to construct a new obstacle for those fit to practice.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Recent research suggests that the prospect of bar inquiries and obstacles to admission deters many law students from seeking mental health treatment.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2235" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2235" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">In one survey of fifteen law schools, over 40 percent of students thought that they had needed help for mental health problems in the prior year, but only about half actually received counseling from a mental health professional.</span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000;" class="NoterefInText">

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Almost half of all survey participants believed that if they had a drug or alcohol problem, their chances of bar admission were better if the problem remained hidden, and 43 percent thought the same about mental health difficulties.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Students’ confidentiality concerns are not without basis. A comprehensive empirical study found substantial costs for many applicants who disclosed mental health treatment: invasion of privacy; financial and emotional consequences related to delay in their admission; fees for lawyers and expert witnesses; and reputational concerns in small communities where applicants might come in contact with lawyers on their character committee later in practice.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Can anything be done to prevent the chilling effects of bar inquiries other than removing questions regarding treatment? A National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being recommended that bars </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">publish data reflecting low rates of denials due to conduct involving mental health and substance abuse disorders.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">If such measures do not sufficiently reduce the chilling effect of bar inquiries concerning treatment, are such inquiries still worth the risk? </span>

        <span style="color: #000000;">[R]esearch in the field, clinical experience and common sense all demonstrate that neither diagnosis nor the fact of having undergone treatment support any inferences about a person’s ability to carry out professional responsibilities or to act with integrity, competence or honor.

        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> In light of this research, in 2019 the Conference of Chief Justices urged states to remove mental health inquiries from their applications, and a petition requesting them to do so has circulated on Change.org.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">. . . . As this Court has observed on numerous occasions, the Constitution does not create property interests. Rather it extends various procedural safeguards to certain interests “that stem from an independent source such as state law.”</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Court of Appeals evidently believed that an out-of-state lawyer’s interest in appearing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> in an Ohio court stems from some such independent source. It cited no state law authority for this proposition, however, and indeed noted that “Ohio has no specific standards regarding </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> admissions. . . .” Rather, the court referred to the prevalence of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> practice in American courts and instances in our history where counsel appearing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> have rendered distinguished service. We do not question that the practice of courts in most States is to allow an out-of-state lawyer the privilege of appearing upon motion, especially when he is associated with a member of the local bar. In view of the high mobility of the bar, and also the trend toward specialization, perhaps this is a practice to be encouraged. But it is not a right granted either by statute or the Constitution. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Nor is there a basis for the argument that the interest in appearing </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> has its source in federal law. The speculative claim that Fahringer’s and Cambria’s reputations might suffer as the result of the denial of their asserted right cannot by itself make out an injury to a constitutionally protected interest. There simply was no deprivation here of some right previously held under state law. Further, there is no right of federal origin that permits such lawyers to appear in state courts without meeting that State’s bar admission requirements. This Court, on several occasions, has sustained state bar rules that excluded out-of-state counsel from practice altogether or on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, because Fahringer and Cambria did not possess a cognizable property interest within the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Constitution does not obligate the Ohio courts to accord them procedural due process in passing on their application for permission to appear </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">A lawyer’s interest in pursuing his calling is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question presented by this case is whether a lawyer abandons that protection when he crosses the border of the State which issued his license to practice.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The Court holds that a lawyer has no constitutionally protected interest in his out-of-state practice. In its view, the interest of the lawyer is so trivial that a judge has no obligation to give any consideration whatsoever to the merits of a </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> request, or to give the lawyer any opportunity to advance reasons in support of his application. The Court’s square holding is that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment simply does not apply to this kind of ruling by a state trial judge.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">

        <span style="color: #000000;"> . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The notion that a state trial judge has arbitrary and unlimited power to refuse a nonresident lawyer permission to appear in his courtroom is nothing but a remnant of a bygone era. . . . Interstate law practice and multistate law firms are now commonplace. Federal questions regularly arise in state criminal trials and permeate the typical lawyer’s practice. Because the assertion of federal claims or defenses is often unpopular, “advice and assistance by an out-of-state lawyer may be the only means available for vindication.” The “increased specialization and high mobility” of today’s Bar is a consequence of the dramatic change in the demand for legal services that has occurred during the past century. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">History attests to the importance of </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> appearances. As Judge Merritt, writing for the Court of Appeals [below] explained: . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">There are a number of reasons for this tradition. ‘The demands of business and the mobility of our society’ are the reasons given by the American Bar Association in Canon 3 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. That Canon discourages ‘territorial limitations’ on the practice of law, including trial practice. There are other reasons in addition to business reasons. A client may want a particular lawyer for a particular kind of case, and a lawyer may want to take the case because of the skill required. Often, as in the case of Andrew Hamilton, Darrow, Bryan and Thurgood Marshall, a lawyer participates in a case out of a sense of justice. He may feel a sense of duty to defend an unpopular defendant and in this way to give expression to his </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page983" class="pagebreak" title="983">983</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">own moral sense. These are important values, both for lawyers and clients, and should not be denied arbitrarily.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The interest these lawyers seek to vindicate is not merely the pecuniary goal that motivates every individual’s attempt to pursue his calling. It is the profession’s interest in discharging its responsibility for the fair administration of justice in our adversary system. The nature of that interest is surely worthy of the protection afforded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s summary disposition of a question of great importance to the administration of justice.</span>

        <span style="color: #000000;"> </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">v. Flynt</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> is an atypical case. Courts generally admit lawyers </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice,</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> although about half of all jurisdictions require association of local counsel. The stated justifications for requiring association with local counsel usually involve concerns about out-of-state attorneys’ familiarity with local practice and procedures, their availability for hearings and service of papers, and their accountability to local disciplinary authorities. Unstated concerns involve economic protectionism and political hostility.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">The latter motivation emerged clearly in efforts by certain Southern courts to prevent out-of-state appearances by civil rights attorneys during the 1950s and 1960s. The constitutionality of such practices remains open to question, particularly since the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Leis v. Flynt</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> majority did not reach the issue of whether defendants might, in some circumstances, be entitled to representation by out-of-state counsel of their choice. How should that issue be resolved?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A more general question involves the appropriateness of easing restrictions on out-of-state lawyers. Absent court approval, attorneys may provide representation only in jurisdictions where they are admitted to the bar. Rule 5.5(d)(1)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.5(d)(1)&quot; \s &quot;5.5(d)(1)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct also permits in-house counsel to provide legal services outside the jurisdictions where they are licensed but only so long as those services “are provided to the lawyer’s employer or organizational affiliates” and also “are not services for which the forum requires </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">pro hac vice</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> admission.” The comment to Rule 5.5 explains that non-locally licensed attorneys may be subject to registration or certification systems that subject them to requirements such as continuing legal education and assessments for client protection funds. As Chapter 13’s discussion of multijurisdictional practice noted, some decisions hold that attorneys may not even offer advice by phone or computer concerning a transaction or dispute arising in a state in which they are not licensed.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2245" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2245" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Attorneys who attempt to avoid unauthorized practice by obtaining admission in multiple jurisdictions bump up against substantial obstacles. Many states require passage of their own bar exam and others will waive </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page984" class="pagebreak" title="984">984</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">exam requirements only for lawyers from jurisdictions that extend the same privileges to the states’ own lawyers.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Such reciprocity rules are difficult to justify from any consumer protection perspective. If experienced out-of-state attorneys are competent to practice, why should it matter how their local bars treat competitors? The situation is tolerable only because bar agencies rarely have sufficient information or resources to enforce prohibitions on out-of-state practice. However, the threat of sanctions can deter attorneys from providing cost-effective representation on multistate matters. Alternatively, clients may have to subsidize an affiliation with local counsel who perform no significant function other than compliance with protectionist admission requirements. Critics thus contend that restrictions on out-of-state attorneys persist largely due to professional self-interest and public inertia. Once admitted to the bar, many lawyers have no incentive to eliminate arbitrary or overbroad restrictions if they lack a substantial interstate practice, particularly where the effect of reform would be to increase the number of potential competitors. How would you address the needs of interstate law practice?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />For a time, states also imposed state residency requirements, licensing only those lawyers that resided in the particular state. In a series of cases in the late 1980s, however, the Supreme Court held that these residency requirements violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2246" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section25.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2246" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> Although the Court did not challenge states’ rights to impose exam requirements on out-of-state attorneys, its reasoning suggested decreasing tolerance for protectionist regulation. Similar concerns encouraged the ABA to appoint a Commission on Multijurisdictional Practice and to adopt its recommended revision of Model Rule 5.5(c). </span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Would a national system of bar admission be preferable? Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky notes that in the medical profession, “there’s a national board of medical examiners that sponsors a national licensing exam: doctors don’t have to pass new tests every time they move from one state to another. Shouldn’t there be a similar system in place for lawyers?”</span>

Mr. Justice Stevens identifies two “protected” interests that “reinforce” each other. These are said to be “the ‘nature’ of the interest in <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice</span> admissions or the ‘implicit promise’ inhering in Ohio custom.” The first of these lawyer’s “interests” is described as that of “discharging [his] responsibility for the fair administration of justice in our adversary system.” As important as this interest is, the suggestion that the Constitution assures the right of a lawyer to practice in the court of every State is a novel one, not supported by any authority brought to our attention.</p>

          <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although the Court does not address it, this case also presents the question whether a defendant’s interest in representation by nonresident counsel is entitled to any constitutional protection. The clients, as well as the lawyers, are parties to this litigation. Moreover, the Ohio trial judge made it perfectly clear that his ruling was directed at the defendants, and not merely their counsel. . . . A defendant’s interest in adequate representation is “perhaps his most important privilege” protected by the Constitution. . . . Whatever the scope of a lawyer’s interest in practicing in other States may be . . . the client’s interest in representation by out-of-state counsel is entitled to some measure of constitutional protection. . . .</span>
