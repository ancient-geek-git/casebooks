      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers’ opportunities for ethical influence are generally greatest in their counseling and advising role. In this role, lawyers can shape the client’s understanding of what the law requires and how to fulfill its purposes. How effectively lawyers exercise this influence depends on a range of situational factors, including who the client is, the nature of the client’s problem, and the lawyers relationship with, and independence from, the client. This chapter explores the lawyer’s counseling role in four representative contexts: criminal, tax, family, and corporate practice.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Each of these areas raises distinctive challenges. In the criminal defense context, we focus on how lawyer advice may influence the choices of clients already in the criminal justice system, where the stakes are high and clients are particularly vulnerable. In the section on tax practice, we explore the distinctive ethical pressures that arise because the temptations for clients to cut corners are especially great, given that the risk of significant penalties is generally small and the public’s sense of moral responsibility to government tax collectors is generally limited.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Family practice poses distinct difficulties because the issues involved often carry considerable emotional as well as ethical freight. Parties have more personally at stake and have greater difficulties making rational decisions than in most other contexts. Moreover, the interests of vulnerable third parties—typically children—may be directly implicated but not formally represented. Furthermore, as we saw in Chapter 6, family counseling can raise complex issues of identifying the client and maintaining confidentiality.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We conclude the chapter with a consideration of counseling in complex corporate contexts. These contexts require lawyers to consider the often competing interests of various stakeholders: management, shareholders, employees, customers, and the public. The problem is complicated because managers generally have disproportionate power and strong views of what they seek to accomplish—and many want lawyers to simply authorize their preconceived plans.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To begin, it is important to mark a key distinction between the lawyer’s role in adversary proceedings versus counseling contexts. Counseling requires that the lawyer step back from client partisanship to offer independent advice based on the lawyer’s best professional judgment. An important question that arises is how strongly to advocate a particular course of action in light of that judgment. When might it be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page584" class="pagebreak" title="584">584</span>the lawyer’s job to persuade the client to follow that judgment, as opposed to simply laying out options? How should the lawyer weigh values other than the client’s, such as the public’s or other inadequately represented stakeholders’ in deciding what is the “right” thing to do? Where is the line between counseling a client who appears likely to engage in crime or fraud and knowing complicity in such unlawful activity? </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Preet Bharara, the celebrated former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, reports that law students have frequently asked him some variation of that last question. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">“Mr. Bharara, you’ve talked about making sure you don’t cross the line and that it’s dangerous to wander too close to the line. So, exactly how far from the line do you recommend people stay?” It is asked as if it were a geometry problem. I say, “Oh, about three and a half feet should do the trick.” I am always a bit taken a bit aback at these attempts to quantify ethics. I answer such questions by explaining that I disagree with the premise of the question; its orientation is unfortunate and off base; that if you are single-mindedly focused on walking the line, you are bound to end up afoul of regulators and, God forbid, criminal prosecutors. Even more dangerous perhaps, you are sending a message to every other person at the firm that line walking is a good idea. That can work for a while, but not forever. A culture of minimalism is lethal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1283" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1283" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Consider that response, along with the other questions that preceded it, in connection with the following overview of counseling approaches. Keep these approaches in mind as you read the context-specific materials that follow.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc335223614" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732441" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733404" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369348" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486964" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861572" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219119" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756527" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908660" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Lon L. Fuller and John D. Randall, “Professional Responsibility: Report of the Joint Conference”</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Vital as is the lawyer’s role in adjudication, it should not be thought that it is only as an advocate pleading in open court that he contributes to the administration of the law. The most effective realization of the law’s aims often takes place in the attorney’s office, where litigation is forestalled by anticipating its outcome, where the lawyer’s quiet counsel takes place of public force. Contrary to popular belief, the compliance with the law thus brought about is not generally lip-serving and narrow, for by reminding him of its long-run costs the lawyer often deters his client from a course of conduct technically permissible under existing law, though inconsistent with its underlying spirit and purpose.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page585" class="pagebreak" title="585">585</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although the lawyer serves the administration of justice indispensably both as advocate and as office counselor, the demands imposed on him by these two roles must be sharply distinguished. The man who has been called into court to answer for his own actions is entitled to a fair hearing. Partisan advocacy plays its essential part in such a hearing, and the lawyer pleading his client’s case may properly present it in the most favorable light. A similar resolution of doubts in one direction becomes inappropriate when the lawyer acts as counselor. The reasons that justify and even require partisan advocacy in the trial of a cause do not grant any license to the lawyer to participate as legal adviser in a line of conduct that is immoral, unfair, or of doubtful legality. In saving himself from this unworthy involvement, the lawyer cannot be guided solely by an unreflective inner sense of good faith; he must be at pains to preserve a sufficient detachment from his client’s interests so that he remains capable of a sound and objective appraisal of the propriety of what his client proposes to do.</p>
      <p class="Center3emDash">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">———</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="_Toc335223615" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732442" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733405" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369349" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486965" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />When it comes to client counseling, one rule is particularly relevant, Rule 2.1. Rule 2.1 requires lawyers in an advisory role to “exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice.” The Rule continues: “In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to the client’s situation.” Although there is very little case law interpreting this rule, Comment 1 explains the meaning of the twin requirements of independence and candor:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[1]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A client is entitled to straightforward advice expressing the lawyer’s honest assessment. Legal advice often involves unpleasant facts and alternatives that a client may be disinclined to confront. In presenting advice, a lawyer endeavors to sustain the client’s morale and may put advice in as acceptable a form as honesty permits. However, a lawyer should not be deterred from giving candid advice by the prospect that the advice will be unpalatable to the client.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The rule also gives lawyers substantial leeway to base their advice on non-legal factors. Here, Comment 2 explains:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Advice couched in narrow legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially where practical considerations, such as cost or effects on other people, are predominant. Purely technical legal advice, therefore, can sometimes be inadequate. It is proper for a lawyer to refer to relevant moral and ethical considerations in giving advice. Although a lawyer is not a moral advisor as such, moral and ethical considerations impinge upon most legal questions and may decisively influence how the law will be applied.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page586" class="pagebreak" title="586">586</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These standards raise important questions about <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> lawyers should bring moral and ethical standards into their counseling role. Most contemporary approaches to ethics in counseling have taken three basic forms: client-centered, collaborative, and contextual.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1284" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1284" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> Although the boundaries among these approaches often blur, they do help identify different understandings of lawyers’ moral responsibilities in advising clients.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861573" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922282" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219120" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756528" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908262" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908661" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A Client-Centered Approach to Counseling</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What distinguishes client-centered counseling, as the term suggests, is the priority that it places on client autonomy.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1285" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1285" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span> Concretely, it means that the lawyer-counselor explains the client’s options, with their plusses and minuses, but leaves the final choice to the client—even if it isn’t a choice the lawyer thinks is wise. Underlying this approach is a belief that clients have the right and capacity to determine their own objectives. In describing counseling relationships, most client-centered commentary assumes that individuals seek legal assistance to pursue interests that are autonomously determined and that lawyers’ basic responsibility is to provide “neutral,” “nonjudgmental” assistance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1286" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1286" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> As proponents note, the lawyer-client relationship is one of agency, which presupposes that attorneys will defer to the party who has retained them, and who will have to live with the results of the representation. This emphasis on autonomy has a distinguished philosophical ancestry: Immanuel Kant argued that individual autonomy is the supreme value, the only thing that is good in itself, because the exercise of free will is what distinguishes rational beings from the rest of nature.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1287" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1287" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> Many philosophers follow Kant in the special value they place on autonomy.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1288" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1288" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet, critics of this client-centered approach raise various concerns. First, as a descriptive matter, critics charge that the client-centered approach does not accurately reflect the role that ethical values other than concern for client autonomy <span style="font-style: italic;">actually</span> play in counseling relationships. Elihu Root is credited with saying that “about half the practice of a decent lawyer consists of telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1289" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1289" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> Further, critics point out that, even <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page587" class="pagebreak" title="587">587</span>when lawyers <span style="font-style: italic;">strive</span> to be neutral, the manner in which they present information inevitably shapes clients’ analysis.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, as a normative matter, critics suggest that client-centeredness does not capture the role that values other than client autonomy <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> play, in order to serve both client and societal interests.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As an initial matter, some take issue with what is meant by “autonomy.” Although many philosophers follow Kant in regarding autonomy as a supreme value, Kant meant by “autonomy” something quite different than simply doing whatever one wishes. Kantian autonomy means the power to act on the basis of duty—in other words, the ability to think and act for moral reasons rather than simply following inclinations. Other moral philosophers argue that individual autonomy is not valuable in itself. Rather, autonomy derives its importance from the other values it fosters, such as personal creativity, initiative, and responsibility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1290" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1290" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span> If a particular client objective does not, in fact, promote those values, or does so only at much greater cost to third parties, then deference to that objective lacks ethical justification.<a id="_Ref31559370" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1291" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1291" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> Although lawyers generally have less expertise in assessing clients’ preferences than clients themselves, lawyers also may have greater capacity to make a disinterested evaluation of third-party concerns.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Thus, from a moral standpoint, some argue that placing absolute priority on client autonomy is difficult to justify, particularly when the client is an organization rather than an individual. An artificial entity like a corporation or a school district has no personality and no autonomy (except as a figure of speech). A corporation’s “right” to maximize profits through unsafe or misleading but imperfectly regulated methods can hardly take ethical precedence over individuals’ rights to be free from unreasonable risks. And, in the real world, such client-centered representation has led to lawyers’ complicity in some of the most socially costly enterprises in recent memory: the distribution of asbestos and Dalkon shields; the suppression of health information about cigarettes; and the financially irresponsible ventures of lending institutions and corporations.<a id="_Ref31559336" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1292" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-top: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">As officers of the court and as gatekeepers in regulatory processes, lawyers have obligations that transcend those owed to any particular client.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1293" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1293" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> Honesty, trust, and fairness are collective goods; neither legal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page588" class="pagebreak" title="588">588</span>nor market systems can function effectively if lawyers lack a basic sense of social responsibility for the consequences of their professional acts.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A related difficulty with client-centered approaches is that they reinforce a restrictive role that often ill serves even client interests. The problems are greatest when a client’s judgment is impaired. As Chapter 5, Section D notes, the impairment may spring from multiple causes: youth, mental health disabilities, peer pressures, economic constraints, or psychological traumas such as divorce. As psychologists note: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[H]owever much we want to avoid manipulating others, however much we want to help or serve others by respecting their knowledge about what’s best for themselves, it’s never as simple as just letting them choose. It’s the human condition to have hazy or conflicting goals, or to be in the grip of some domineering passion, or to be unclear about the consequences of our actions.<a id="_Ref31559405" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1294" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1294" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Under some circumstances, individuals may be poorly situated to take a long-term view of their interests or live up to their own moral values.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-top: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Less obviously, a variety of cognitive biases often prevents even seemingly rational business clients from accurately assessing facts that are economically inconvenient to acknowledge. Situational influences and psychological predispositions often converge to lead managers of organizations to overlook or rationalize unsafe and fraudulent activity.<a id="_Ref31558329" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1295" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1295" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> For example, short-term profit incentives tempt decision-makers to discount non-quantifiable considerations such as public reaction and the risks of detection. Once managers have committed to particular projects, they are inclined to construe events in ways that confirm prior beliefs, and downplay risks and countervailing evidence.<a id="_Ref31558292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1296" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> Such “cognitive conservatism” and “overconfidence effects” may blind decision makers to evidence of deception or adverse social consequences.<a id="_Ref31558486" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1297" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1297" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> Group decisionmaking processes can compound the problem, as a diffusion of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page589" class="pagebreak" title="589">589</span>responsibility and fears of alienating colleagues (which are often justifiable) may work to further suppress unwelcome information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1298" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1298" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A similar problem arises when clients are entities that can only speak through agents with competing concerns. Managers’ desires to maximize their own income, power, or status within an organization may encourage them to make decisions that are not in the broader interest of other stakeholders. Since lawyers’ ethical responsibilities run to the entity, not to any particular constituent, lawyers’ counseling responsibilities need to take account of such conflicting concerns.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1299" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1299" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> Unfortunately, some client-centered commentary ignores these responsibilities, and assumes a kind of individual counseling relationship that is out of touch with organizational complexities. William Simon refers to this as the “Managerialist Fallacy”: Lawyers become complicit in corporate misconduct when they fail “to observe to the distinction between the organization’s interests and those of its senior managers.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1300" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1300" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span> Nor are these issues limited to misconduct—managers’ understandable self-interests reinforced by cognitive biases may cause them to make bad business decisions that harm the company, while the client-centered counsel keeps silent against his or her better judgment.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861574" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922283" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219121" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756529" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908263" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908662" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />B.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A Collaborative Approach to Counseling</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The second main approach to counseling, which stresses collaboration between lawyers and clients, offers many of the same strengths as client-centered approaches while at least partly compensating for their major limitations. As the term suggests, collaborative counseling envisions lawyers and clients as co-venturers in problem solving, jointly responsible for its ethical implications. In general, the client’s preferred course of action prevails unless the attorney finds it self-destructive or “morally wrong.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1301" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span> As such, collaborative frameworks recognize that one of lawyers’ most valuable contributions is to engage and enlarge their clients’ moral vision, and to encourage decisions that express parties’ highest principles.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1302" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1302" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> By the same token, clients can enlarge lawyers’ moral vision; the collaborative approach to counseling favors dialogue that is a genuine two-way street. A promising application of this approach is reflected in the branch of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page590" class="pagebreak" title="590">590</span>family law practice that has claimed the same term.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1303" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1303" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span> Under this approach, parties commit to collaborate with each other as well as with their lawyers in seeking fair, out-of-court agreements based on full disclosure. If the parties fail to reach such a settlement, the lawyers may not represent them in further proceedings, a condition designed to give all participants a substantial stake in mutually beneficial problem solving.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course, this approach has its own limitations. If lawyers must withdraw when unable to achieve a negotiated resolution, the costs of reeducating new counsel may be sufficient to coerce some participants into accepting undesirable agreements. Individuals who are most in need of ethical advice are probably least likely to agree to collaborative approaches. Moreover, under competitive pressures, the risk is that even collaborative lawyers will too closely identify with clients’ self-perceived interests. Many of the lawyers involved in the 2001 Enron scandal (discussed below and in more detail in Chapter 6) found their client’s conduct not so unambiguously illegal or immoral that they were unable to rationalize assistance, in what turned out to be devastating securities frauds that destroyed the company, ruined employees, and sent managers to prison. Vinson &amp; Elkins, the primary law firm representing Enron, managed to find its highly misleading accounting strategies “creative and aggressive,” not deceptive or fraudulent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1304" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1304" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> It is scarcely coincidental that this admiration involved a client that had accounted for a substantial proportion of the firm’s annual revenue and had employed some twenty of the firm’s former lawyers. In such circumstances, collaborative approaches that cast lawyers as co-venturers with their clients risk understating the need for independent judgment and the economic pressures that get in its way.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">A final approach to counseling is more contextual and acknowledges a greater responsibility for the consequences of professional advice. As the label “contextual” indicates, under this approach, lawyers must decide how client-centered their assistance should be under the particular circumstances of their representation. Relevant factors include the significance of the ethical concerns at issue and the lawyer’s information, responsibility, and capacity to affect outcomes. Unlike <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page591" class="pagebreak" title="591">591</span>either the “client-centered” model, which makes the client’s autonomous objectives preeminent, or the “collaborative” model, which invites the client, in consultation with the attorney, to “draw on his own moral resources” in resolving issues, contextual approaches acknowledge a significant independent role for the lawyers’ own ethical judgments.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1305" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1305" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> What this approach entails will vary depending on the context. A morally justifiable response need not involve lawyers imposing their values on clients. Rather, the lawyer’s willingness to take a stance may simply encourage clients to reconsider their position, or to accept the financial and psychological consequences of finding alternative counsel.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Like the other approaches, contextual counseling has its drawbacks. Most obviously, clients may resent overly-intrusive counseling by their lawyers, particularly if the clients have asked what they consider to be a purely legal question. Even though Rule 2.1 gives substantial leeway for lawyers to engage in moral advice, that role may be an unfamiliar one for which lawyers’ training does not necessarily equip them. In the problems that follow later in this chapter, consider the implications of each of the three models, in order to determine which seems most appropriate.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As we saw in our discussion of lawyer-client decisionmaking in Chapter 5, lawyers play an important role in counseling clients to comply with law. Rule 1.2(d) mandates that a lawyer “shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent,” though a lawyer “may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law.” We explore the line between appropriate discussion of legal consequences and inappropriate assistance in criminal or fraudulent action below. Here, our focus is on the role of counseling <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> a client has been charged with a crime, especially in the fraught decision of whether to accept a plea bargain. How should a lawyer advise a criminal defendant facing a potentially life-altering punishment?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">William Simon recounts a case that he encountered as an inexperienced attorney. His client, Mrs. Jones, was a sixty-five-year-old black woman charged with leaving the scene of an accident. He obtained strong evidence that the charge was unfounded; remarks made to her by police officers also suggested that her arrest was racially motivated. Given the strength of that evidence, Simon believed his client would prevail at trial. Concerned about his own inexperience, however, he enlisted the aid of a friend, an experienced criminal defense lawyer. That <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page592" class="pagebreak" title="592">592</span>lawyer promptly negotiated a plea bargain that would result in six months’ probation. Simon, however, was unhappy that if Mrs. Jones accepted the plea, she would lose her opportunity for vindication as well as her chance to expose gross police misconduct. Still, he presented the plea offer to Mrs. Jones and her minister (who had accompanied her to the courthouse to serve as a character witness):</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">I insisted that, because the decision was hers, I couldn’t tell her what to do. I then spelled out the pros and cons. . . . However, I mentioned the cons last, and the final thing I said was, “If you took their offer, there probably wouldn’t be any bad practical consequences, but it wouldn’t be total justice.” Up to that point, Mrs. Jones and her minister seemed anxiously ambivalent, but that last phrase seemed to have a dramatic effect on them. In unison, they said, “We want justice.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">I went back to my friend and said, “No deal. She wants justice.” My friend stared in disbelief and then said, “Let me talk to her.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">He then proceeded to give her his advice. He didn’t tell her what he thought she should do, and he went over the same considerations I did. The main differences in his presentation were that he discussed the disadvantages of trial last, while I had gone over them first; he described the remote possibility of jail in slightly more detail than I had; and he didn’t conclude by saying, “It wouldn’t be total justice.” At the end of his presentation, Mrs. Jones and her minister decided to accept the plea bargain. As I said nothing further, that’s what they did.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1306" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1306" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">In commenting on the case, Simon noted:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">My guess is that most people will have some doubts about whether Mrs. Jones’s ultimate decision was autonomous. Before we explore these doubts, however, we should consider a prior set of circumstances that seems to represent a paradox for the autonomy view.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Mrs. Jones did not want to be autonomous in the way that the autonomy view contemplates. She asked me to make the decision for her. She would have been immensely relieved if I had told her without explanation what to do, and she would have done it.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Now most people recognize that a commitment to individual autonomy requires the condemnation of some individual choices that, however seemingly autonomous in themselves, would preclude capacity for further autonomous choice. Choosing to sell yourself into slavery is the classic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page593" class="pagebreak" title="593">593</span>example. So long as these choices seem crazy or highly unusual, the contradiction they pose for the commitment to autonomy is not that serious.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">However, I don’t think that Mrs. Jones’s desire for an “escape from freedom” was crazy or highly unusual. Decisionmaking of this kind involves anxiety. Moreover, some people may reasonably believe that they are not very good at it. In such circumstances, the opportunity to put your fate in the hands of an apparently benevolent expert may seem attractive. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Proponents of the autonomy view are likely to respond that the problem illustrated by Mrs. Jones’s case is not the implausibility of the autonomy ideal, but the failure to implement it competently on the part of her lawyers. They would suggest that the discussion was too hurried and pressured and the advice was less informative and neutral than it should have been. Although such criticisms have substance, they tend to underestimate some intractable problems. Time is scarce in nearly all practice situations, and the difficulties of framing unbiased advice are often overwhelming.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[In Mrs. Jones’s case, my] friend and I made clear to her that there was a theoretical possibility of a jail term if she were convicted, even though we both thought this probability tiny, and this knowledge visibly evoked anxiety and fear in Mrs. Jones. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Most practicing lawyers would probably approve our conduct. Such judgments are based on assumptions that lawyers necessarily rely on about what a client’s goals are likely to be. Most lawyers would assume that even a small probability of jail would be important to most clients. . . . The compatibility of such assumptions with the autonomy view depends on the extent to which the assumption accurately reflects client ends. My own impression is that they are often too crude to serve as reliable guides. For example, in Mrs. Jones’s case, I think the conventional assumptions about the jail penalty . . . were wrong.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Going to jail would have been a disastrous outcome for Mrs. Jones. However, it was also a very unlikely outcome. As a purely cognitive matter, most people have difficulty rationally (that is, consistently) making decisions about risk. When the decision involves an outcome that evokes strong emotions and vivid images, the difficulty is compounded. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">In Mrs. Jones’s case, I think my friend and I should have either omitted mention of jail entirely or characterized it [as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page594" class="pagebreak" title="594">594</span>negligible risk]. . . . I think she was bound to be disabled by any description of jail as a real, even if small, possibility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1307" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1307" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Do you agree with William Simon? Does it follow from his view that genuine client autonomy is impossible, at least in cases with a strong emotional component? Does client-centered counseling assume that client autonomy is always a realistic possibility?</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In commenting on this example, Barry Schwartz and Kenneth Sharpe disagree with Simon’s approach and his subsequent suggestion of an alternative. They write: </span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">To offer wise counsel, Simon needed to help Mrs. Jones perceive her situation and imagine alternatives. To do that he needed the know-how to listen and the skill to ask the kinds of questions that would help her reflect on her situation. He needed the empathy to understand what she was thinking and feeling. Developing that empathy required that Simon get to know Mrs. Jones. This kind of knowledge doesn’t come in the five minutes before a hearing begins. Simon did not have this wisdom to counsel, and neither did his friend. So they went through the motions of letting Mrs. Jones choose for herself . . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[Some might query,] [w]ouldn’t it be better if [her lawyers] presented the facts to her in a neutral way? That would maximize her autonomy and let her truly decide what best served her interests. But as we’ve said, there is no neutral. No matter what they said, their tone of voice, their body language, the order in which they but the facts and how they emphasized would have framed the issue for her. What Simon and his colleague could have done if they were wiser counselors was to enable Mrs. Jones to frame the situation better by helping her reflect more calmly about her interests and beliefs and about the consequences of each option given the particulars of her life.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1308" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1308" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Counseling in tax practice confronts lawyers with difficult questions about how to promote compliance with the letter and spirit of the tax code in the face of client incentives to minimize their tax liability. Should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page595" class="pagebreak" title="595">595</span>lawyers advise clients in ways that help them take advantage of technically available, but questionable, loopholes that undercut the purpose of the tax? Should lawyers provide clients advice about the (negligible) likelihood of being audited if they suspect that information might lead clients to cheat on their tax returns?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As these questions suggest, ethical issues in tax practice reflect both the particular nature of its regulatory framework and the more general tensions arising from lawyers’ competing responsibilities. These issues have become more important as the nation has become increasingly dependent on revenue from self-reporting income tax systems. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) budget has been slashed and the audit rate cut in half over the past decade; the Service can afford to audit only about 1 to 2 percent of returns.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1309" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1309" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> In the most recent year for which data is available, more than 150 million returns were filed, but the IRS brought only 800 cases of criminal tax evasion.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1310" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1310" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Audits reveal high levels of underpayment. Estimates suggest that <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">the annual tax gap—the difference between the tax collected and the tax owed—is around $450 billion, or 16.9 percent of the total tax liability.</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1311" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1311" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> The low audit rates create a tax cheaters’ lottery—the only lottery in which the overwhelming majority of players are winners.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1312" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1312" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> One IRS-sponsored study revealed that 42 percent of all returns had some understatement of reported income, and surveys of taxpayers reveal even higher levels of evasion.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1313" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Although about 80 to 90 percent of Americans say that cheating on taxes is morally wrong, substantial numbers of those individuals manage to rationalize their own noncompliance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1314" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1314" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers have been involved in some egregious examples of noncompliance with tax laws, as illustrated by the 2016 “Panama Papers” scandal. A Panama firm that specialized in secretive shell companies and illegal offshore tax shelters assisted some 14,000 clients in 100 countries before a leak of 11 million documents revealed the abuses.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1315" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1315" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> There is no reason to believe that this law firm is a unique bad actor; it was merely the one that got caught.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1316" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1316" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> The role of tax lawyers in widening or narrowing the compliance gap is the subject of the material <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page596" class="pagebreak" title="596">596</span>that follows. To understand these problems, a brief overview of regulatory structures and bar interpretations is helpful.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Taxpayers face penalties for both fraud and accuracy-related violations not rising to the level of fraud. For fraudulent underpayments, taxpayers are subject to penalties of 75 percent of the amount due. <a id="dabmci_de82dd8c86dd46e9a5bb688e49de41b7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />26 U.S.C. § 6663. For accuracy-related violations, taxpayers are liable for penalties of 20 percent of the resulting underpayment unless they can establish good faith and reasonable cause. <a id="dabmci_25c61cff7c4b4a79b4e3256d5fd96781" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />26 U.S.C. §§ 6662, 6664.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Tax preparers may also be subject to penalties. The Code imposes a penalty of $1,000 (or 50 percent of the income derived by the preparer with respect to the return in question, whichever is greater) if a tax return takes a position for which there was no “substantial authority” (so long as the preparer knew, or reasonably should have known, of the position). If the position is adequately disclosed, the penalty applies only if there was no reasonable basis for the position.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1317" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> However, if the understatement was due to a “willful attempt in any manner to understate” tax liability or “a reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations,” the preparer penalty goes up to $5,000 (or 50 percent of the income derived by the preparer with respect to the return in question).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1318" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1318" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Further, under Circular 230, the IRS may also impose sanctions, including suspension or disbarment from practice before it, against any preparer who engages in disreputable conduct. Such conduct includes knowing provision of false or misleading information to the IRS.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1319" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1319" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> Circular 230 further provides that a practitioner may not sign a return if the preparer “knows or reasonably should know” that the return “[l]acks a reasonable basis” or is “a willful attempt . . . to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1320" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1320" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>In general, a position is unreasonable “unless there is or was substantial authority for the position.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1321" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1321" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> However, for tax shelters and reportable transactions, a transaction is unreasonable unless “it is reasonable to believe that the position would more likely than not be sustained on its merits.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1322" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1322" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>The “more likely than not” standard is met “if the tax return preparer analyzes the pertinent facts and authorities and, in reliance upon that analysis, reasonably concludes in good faith that the position has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained on its merits.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1323" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1323" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span></p>

      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861580" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219127" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756535" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908668" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 1</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Your client has agreed in principle to pay $3.2 million for an apartment building and the acre of land on which it sits. The building is a wasting asset that may be depreciated (thus generating tax deductions over the useful life of the building). The land is non-depreciable. It is, therefore, in your client’s interest to attribute as much of the sale price as possible to the apartment building. The seller is indifferent to how the purchase price is allocated.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You have asked two real estate experts who often work with your firm for appraisals. One values the building at $1.6 million, and a second at $1.8 million. These figures strike you as somewhat higher than those that an entirely neutral expert would select, but they do not appear grossly inflated. Your client then finds another appraiser who values the building at $2.4 million. In your client’s view, that is a fairer estimate, and he would like you to prepare sales documents and tax returns using that figure. How do you respond? Is your advice affected by past experience indicating that if the IRS audits the return, they are likely to assume some overvaluation and may discount the value allocated to the building by about 10 percent regardless of which figure you use?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861581" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219128" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756536" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908669" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Problem 1 is a variation on a hypothetical appearing in a landmark survey of tax practitioners before the promulgation of <a id="dabmci_1fb89a8c0e6745c7904f6ea889288ba8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Formal Opinion 85–352 (excerpted above). Under that hypothetical, the lawyer needed to price <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page598" class="pagebreak" title="598">598</span>some stock of a closely-held family corporation in preparing an estate return. Two neutral experts put the stock’s value at about $50 per share. However, its book value was $30, and because it was a minority interest and would be hard to sell, it could have been discounted to $22.50. Surveyed practitioners were aware of the IRS’s practice of assuming some underreporting and attaching a “mendacity premium” to whatever value the taxpayer selected. Under those hypothesized circumstances, none of the surveyed practitioners would report the value of the shares at $50. About a third would report at $40, and the majority at $30 or less.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1324" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1324" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Such attitudes have prompted several regulatory responses, including increased penalties for overvaluation and undervaluation of property (discussed above), requirements concerning the qualifications of appraisers in certain circumstances, and the “good faith/realistic possibility of success” standard of Opinion 85–352.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In 1990, Frederic G. Corneel published proposed Guidelines to Tax Practice Second with consultation by members of the ABA Section on Taxation’s Committee on Standards of Tax Practice. These Guidelines have also attempted to raise practice standards. They provide:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[W]hile there is nothing wrong in either the appraiser or the preparer giving the client the benefit of the doubt where the value [of property] is uncertain, any valuation involved in a return that we prepare must be responsibly done, make sense, be well-reasoned, and be internally consistent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1325" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1325" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If your firm generally supported the proposed Guidelines to Tax Practice, how would you proceed on the facts in Problem 1?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How important to your advice is the IRS practice of attaching a “mendacity premium” to reported values? Does the Service have any realistic alternative, given its resource constraints and the resulting incentives for taxpayers and appraisers? Can you permit a client to undervalue assets anticipating the IRS premium? Under these circumstances, is all fair in love, war, and IRS valuation disputes?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should you ever discuss with your client the low probability of an audit? Tax law professor Tanina Rostain notes that attorneys</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">signal their own attitude toward the legal framework and the posture they believe a client should adopt—respectful, disdainful, alienated or other—through the ways they talk about the law as much as in the specifics they impart. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 23.4pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">A lawyer who has a socially responsible view of her role can make clear that taking into account a low audit rate is inappropriate in deciding whether to claim a deduction, even while she provides the specific information. When not assuming the persona of “bad men,” people are often responsive to the argument that if everyone based their decision to pay taxes on low <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page599" class="pagebreak" title="599">599</span>enforcement rates, government would grind to a halt. Communicating enforcement information is not inconsistent with expressing one’s view that it is irrelevant in most circumstances to the issue of compliance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1326" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1326" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />An experienced corporate tax expert recalls the following situation. A long-time client came to him and said, “I’d like to get your off-the-cuff reaction about whether the deal I’m putting together is legal. I absolutely don’t want you to do any research or get anyone else to do research. I just want to hear what you think. If <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span> gut reaction is that it’s legal, I’m willing to bet that the IRS is never going to call me on it.” The lawyer understood the client’s point: If he researched the law, he might find out that the deal was improper. The client did not really want to know whether the law supported his deal. He wanted to know only whether the deal looked good enough not to raise an expert’s suspicions.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Can the lawyer answer the client’s question as posed? Does Rule 2.1 give any guidance? How should the lawyer proceed with the conversation?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1327" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1327" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The issue of tax compliance gained increased public attention during the 2016 presidential campaign. Media reports showed that President Donald Trump and his companies had been involved in over a hundred lawsuits and legal disputes concerning taxes in the decade before his election as president.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1328" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1328" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> Some involved property valuations. For example, in a financial disclosure form prepared for his presidential campaign, President Trump valued a Westchester golf club at over $50 million, while at that same time he argued in a tax assessment dispute that it was worth only $1.4 million.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1329" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1329" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> If you had been one of President Trump’s lawyers, how would you have advised him concerning such disparities in value? </p>

Some commentators have recommended more demanding requirements that would allow lawyers to advance only positions they reasonably believe to be meritorious. By contrast, other commentators believe that if requirements for lawyers extend too far beyond those that seem acceptable to most taxpayers, they will rely on accountants and other service providers instead, or will shop for attorneys willing to skirt their ethical obligations. These commentators believe that other reforms aimed at underreporting would be preferable, such as increased penalties or expanded enforcement resources.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1330" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1330" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Are such alternatives politically realistic? Consider W. Bradley Wendel’s argument that the rule of law in tax practice would be undermined <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page600" class="pagebreak" title="600">600</span>if lawyers refused to interpret tax law in good faith based on its obvious intent.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1331" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1331" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Your client, a full-time physician, raises poodles, which she enters from time to time in local competitions. An acquaintance recently told her that it is possible to deduct the expenses connected with her dogs if she is showing them professionally. She seeks your advice. Although she considers herself “something of a professional,” she would never consider selling any of her four dogs, and the prizes at local competitions are far too small to defray her costs.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under <a id="dabmci_daf43afa47ce47dc8e6c0c9abe8d3087" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Treasury Regulations § 1.183–2, the costs of an activity are nondeductible if the taxpayer engages in it primarily as a hobby, but are deductible if the taxpayer enters into the activity with the objective of making a profit. Factors relevant in assessing whether the activity is for profit include whether it is carried on in a businesslike fashion with appropriate books and records, the taxpayer’s expertise, and the time and effort expended on the activity.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861583" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219130" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756538" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908671" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How do you advise your client? If she never kept books and records in the past, may you advise her to begin now and prepare a return claiming the dog expenses as a deduction?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Where is the dividing line between manufacturing intent and helping clients “put their best foot forward”? Should you ask your client whether she is trying to make a profit before you explain the relevant regulations? If she says no, is she bound by her initial uninformed statement of purpose? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In tax contexts, a recurring question is whether clients should be bound by the way they characterize their motives before they become aware of the tax consequences. For example, a frequently quoted exchange among tax experts involves a hypothetical in which a client indicated that he would like to “save some tax money” by splitting a corporation into two entities after a friend reportedly “divided his business and saved quite a bit.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1332" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1332" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> Under regulations then applicable, deductions were not available if the “principal purpose” of the split was to achieve a tax advantage. According to one practitioner, the client’s opening statement should not deprive him of the “right to an examination of his factual situation and legal advice as to what his rights are. . . . [An attorney could appropriately] explore the situation to see whether or not . . . there was justifiable basis for proceeding on a basis other than the tax advantage alone.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1333" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1333" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> By contrast, David Herwitz, a Harvard Law School tax specialist, observed:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page601" class="pagebreak" title="601">601</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[W]hen a fellow has come in and stated his objective in the way described here, . . . [although] there may well be some other quite adequate business reasons [for the split], there is a real question as to whether one could ever overcome the likelihood of the stated purpose being at least a major purpose, since it is the only one the client starts with on his own.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1334" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1334" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Ethics professors divide along similar lines. One view is that individuals are naturally inclined to recollect facts in ways that favor their interests, so clients are entitled to know what their interests are before they commit themselves to a particular version of the truth. Any alternative view would penalize less sophisticated clients. Other commentators make similar factual assumptions but arrive at a different conclusion. From their perspective, providing a motive for lying and then asking for the truth asks too much of human nature. While sophisticated clients may be better able to deceive without assistance, it does not follow that a lawyer’s role is to give everyone equal skills in deception.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Where do you fall in this debate? What considerations would be relevant to your decisions to assist the taxpayer in Problem 2?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If you advise the client in Problem 2 that the IRS is likely to disallow the proposed exemptions, but she wishes to disregard your advice, should you withdraw from representation?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Former federal judge and legal scholar Richard Posner notes that “brilliant lawyers create, discover, and enlarge tax loopholes. This activity is purely redistributive; there is no social gain. In fact there is a net social loss . . . because their beaver-like activities require more carefully drafted and complex tax codes.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1335" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1335" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> He quips: “Social welfare might increase if the IQs of all tax lawyers could be reduced by 10 percent.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1336" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1336" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Is there any problem with tax lawyers advising clients on the legality of loopholes that they themselves have devised?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="_Toc335732451" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Lawyers in divorce and custody cases play a variety of roles. Which roles a practitioner assumes depends in part on clients’ objectives, but also on the attorney’s own values.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At one end of the spectrum are “bombers”—lawyers who identify strongly with the neutral partisan function described in Chapter 4. From their perspective, the attorney’s job is to get clients the result they want, as long as those results are not illegal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1337" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1337" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span> Since divorce rarely brings out the best in human relationships, what some clients want is for their spouses to suffer as much as possible. For the bomber, the counseling role involves mainly strategic planning and tactical advice about how to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page602" class="pagebreak" title="602">602</span>achieve whatever financial and psychological objectives that their clients identify. According to one lawyer interviewed by a former chair of the ABA Family Section’s Ethics Committee, “[n]early all divorce practitioners criticize the bomber . . . but in the current moral climate, nothing succeeds like success.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1338" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1338" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the other end of the spectrum are lawyers who view themselves as constructive problem solvers and officers of the court with a clear affirmative duty to foster an appropriate resolution for children as well as clients. From this perspective, attorneys’ primary counseling obligation is to help divorcing spouses reach durable financial agreements and maintain cooperative parenting relationships. A growing number of these lawyers adopt the collaborative approach described above.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Some other lawyers place a high priority on minimizing the emotional wear-and-tear of family disputes. These practitioners often view their clients as “volatile,” “irrational,” and “unrealistic.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1339" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1339" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span> For these attorneys, the objective is to avoid emotionally-laden discussion and to help parties concentrate on the nuts-and-bolts aspects of their agreement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course, these role descriptions reflect extreme types; most attorneys’ actual behavior relies on a mix of strategies that vary across cases. Much may depend on the needs of clients, their relationships with their spouses, and (if applicable) the interests of children. However, research on family practitioners also reveals significant differences in lawyers’ approaches to their role. For example, in one study that asked lawyers to identify their goal in representing matrimonial clients, about a third reported that they sought a fair settlement. A quarter reported that they attempted to get “the most for the client,” and about 40 percent reported mixed strategies.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1340" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1340" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> All of these approaches can raise ethical concerns, but some are obviously more problematic than others.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The difficulties with the bomber strategy are readily apparent. A lawyer who helps a client punish a former spouse or obtain a skewed agreement may be undermining the client’s long-term interests in establishing sustainable settlements and co-parenting relationships. Such interests, although hard to quantify, may have far more enduring value than the financial gain available through hard-ball tactics. Moreover, experts universally agree that open conflict between parents <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page603" class="pagebreak" title="603">603</span>causes significant difficulties for children, and that those adverse effects are likely to be felt by all members of the family.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1341" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1341" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A different set of difficulties arise for lawyers who see themselves as officers of the court with responsibilities to the entire family. In an ideal world, perhaps, children would remain in close contact with both parents, who would live near enough and have a sufficiently cooperative relationship to make such contact possible. In the <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> world, however, the interests of parents and children are not always fully consistent or compatible, and hard tradeoffs are sometimes necessary.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, lawyers who attempt to dodge emotional issues also may be ill serving their clients’ long-term interests. Family disputes often trigger deep anxiety, stress, anger, and guilt. Yet many individuals who experience such difficulties do not obtain assistance from mental health professionals. Clients who are deterred by the cost and perceived stigma of therapy may want or need assistance from their attorneys in coping with the psychological dimensions of divorce. Counsel who have special expertise, experience, or simply distance from the family situation can often provide a crucial perspective. Their assistance may encourage clients to adopt a long-term perspective, to give adequate consideration to their children’s welfare, or to obtain support from other sources in the community. By contrast, lawyers who focus on narrow legal and financial issues too often end up talking past concerns that are most central to clients’ well-being.

      <p class="FileLine">(2000).</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;" class="TextHeadCentered">
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Preliminary Statement</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The traditional view of the matrimonial lawyer (a view still held by many practitioners) is of the “zealous advocate” whose only job is to win. However, the emphasis on zealous representation of individual clients in criminal and some civil cases is not always appropriate in family law matters. Public opinion (both within and outside the AAML [American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers]) has increasingly supported other models of lawyering and goals of conflict resolution in appropriate cases. A counseling, problem-solving approach for people in need of help in resolving difficult issues and conflicts within the family is one model; this is sometimes referred to as “constructive advocacy.” Mediation and arbitration offer alternative models. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Matrimonial lawyers should recognize the effect that their words and actions have on their client’s attitudes about the justice system, not just on the “legal outcome” of their cases. As a counselor, a problem-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page604" class="pagebreak" title="604">604</span>solving lawyer encourages problem solving in the client. Effective advocacy for a client means considering with the client what is in the client’s best interests and determining the most effective means to achieve that result. The client’s best interests include the well-being of children, family peace, and economic stability.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These Bounds [of Advocacy] reaffirm the attorney’s obligation to competently represent individual clients. These Bounds also promote a problem-solving approach that considers the client’s children and family as well. In addition, they encourage efforts to reduce the cost, delay and emotional trauma and urge interaction between parties and attorneys on a more reasoned, cooperative level.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">1.3<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /></span>An attorney should refuse to assist in vindictive conduct and should strive to lower the emotional level of a family dispute by treating all other participants with respect.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Comment</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">. . . Although the client has the right to determine the “objectives of representation,” after consulting with the client the attorney may limit the objectives and the means by which the objectives are to be pursued. The matrimonial lawyer should make every effort to lower the emotional level of the interaction among parties and counsel. Some dissension and bad feelings can be avoided by a frank discussion with the client at the outset of how the attorney handles cases, including what the attorney will and will not do regarding vindictive conduct or actions likely to adversely affect the children’s interests.

Frequent communication with the client on important matters (1) empowers the client, (2) satisfies the client’s need for information about the progress of the case, (3) helps build a positive attorney-client relationship, and (4) helps the client understand the amount and nature of the work the attorney is performing, thereby reducing concern that nothing is happening and that the attorney’s fees are not being earned. While the attorney should understand that a pending divorce is usually the most important matter in the life of the client, the client should understand that a successful lawyer has many clients, all of whom believe their case to be the most important.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The economic and emotional turmoil caused by marital disputes often affects a client’s ability to make rational decisions in his own best interest. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The lawyer is not compelled to follow irrational or potentially harmful directives of a client, particularly one who is distraught or impaired, even if the client is legally competent. The lawyer should oppose any client’s illegal or improper decision (“I don’t care what the court says, I won’t pay her a cent”). The attorney should attempt to dissuade the client before accepting any clearly detrimental decision. The attorney should consider consulting others who might have a stabilizing influence on the client such as the client’s therapist, doctor or clergy. It would normally be improper for the attorney to seek appointment of a guardian in such a situation because to do so may be expensive, traumatic and adversely affect the client’s interest.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">When rejection of the attorney’s advice is likely to adversely affect the client’s interests, the attorney should document both the advice and the client’s refusal to follow it. Such documentation emphasizes the risk to the client and protects the attorney from subsequent allegations of complicity in the conduct or failure to properly advise the client of the risks involved. In appropriate cases, the attorney may withdraw from representation.</p>

The matrimonial lawyer should counsel against, and refuse to assist, such conduct. Proper consideration for the welfare of the children requires that they not be used as pawns in the divorce process. . . . If despite the attorney’s advice the client persists, the attorney should seek to withdraw.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One of your current clients is an especially anxious and lonely older man. He calls frequently for advice about matters somewhat related <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page606" class="pagebreak" title="606">606</span>to his divorce, but it seems plain that he primarily wants to talk. You have made clear to him that all the time spent on telephone conversations will be billed at your standard hourly rates. He says he understands and pays your fees regularly without complaint. The frequency of his calls is increasing and the press of other work leaves you unwilling to return some of those calls.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How does your conduct square with bar ethical rules and the Matrimonial Lawyers Standards of Conduct? Should you be subject to any sanctions for failing to make prompt responses? What strategies for coping with such a client would be appropriate?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1342" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1342" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You represent a severely depressed woman in a custody dispute over her four- and eight-year-old sons. Her former husband is seeking to reopen the couple’s original divorce agreement. That agreement gave the parties joint legal custody and the mother physical custody. The father now claims that your client is unable to cope with the needs of the children and that her vindictiveness toward him has made the joint custody arrangement unworkable. He notes that his older son never does his homework and is not involved in any school activities. His younger son appears deeply conflicted about the divorce, in part because your client makes accusations that undermine the child’s relationship with him. Finally, he believes that a man who is now dating your client has abused the children, and is not a good influence in their development. If the father’s efforts to obtain physical custody of the boys are unsuccessful, he plans to have no further contact with them. Although he would retain formal custodial rights and would continue to pay child support, the father would stop visiting and calling his sons.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Your client denies that any physical abuse has taken place, although she concedes that her new partner once spanked the boys under circumstances calling for discipline. While acknowledging that he is not particularly “good with children,” your client believes that her new partner will improve over time. Although she knows she has not been spending enough time with the boys since the divorce, she expects that will change as well. She is determined neither to make any concessions concerning custody, nor to suppress her criticism of her former husband in the children’s presence. When you indicate that this conduct may be harming the boys, she responds that the real harm was her husband’s emotional abuse, which ended their marriage. When you suggest that she might benefit from counseling, she tells you that she has already spent more than she can afford on psychiatrists and that what she needs now is a tough lawyer. Your client also believes that her former husband is now having a closeted relationship with a former prostitute, which does not bother her but might bother the judge who will make the custody determination.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers for corporations often take their daily directions from managers who have a strong vision of precisely what they want their lawyers to do. Corporate lawyers, in turn, are often economically dependent on their clients, particularly if they are in-house counsel, as we will see in the next chapter. These features of corporate practice may compromise the very independence that is considered necessary to render effective legal advice. Consider Robert Gordon’s discussion of the responsibilities that such lawyers face, and the choices available to them.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Take one of the most routine contexts of business law practice, compliance counseling. The client hopes to seize a profitable opportunity. The plan is routed through the lawyer’s office and is seen to pose a potential problem: Some legal doctrine or regulation arguably prohibits the plan. What can the lawyer do? Here is a simple, nonexhaustive array of the types of advice a lawyer can give in the context of compliance counseling. The lawyer might advise that:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The plan in its current form is prohibited; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The plan is clearly prohibited, but the risk of detection is slight or, if significant, expected profits will still exceed the likely penalties; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (b) except that the lawyer advises that there is a non-negligible risk of getting caught and being exposed to later liabilities, so that prudence dictates forbearance; </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page608" class="pagebreak" title="608">608</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The form of the plan is clearly prohibited, but can be cosmetically recast in another form that will accomplish its essential purposes; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The substance of the plan is clearly prohibited, but can be made legal if altered in some substantive particulars; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">f)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The plan contravenes the regulations’ basic purposes, but it technically complies with the regulations, and is legal; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">g)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (f), except that the lawyer advises that the plan is illegal; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">h)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (f), except that the lawyer advises that the plan is only technically legal, and that there is some risk that the regulators or courts will be interested in substance rather than form; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">i)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (f), except that the lawyer advises that although adoption of the plan is technically legal, outsiders may perceive it as immoral or unscrupulous, so that for the sake of appearances or morale the plan should be altered or abandoned;</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">j)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (f), except that the lawyer advises that the plan, though it may survive technical review, is wrong—violative of general norms of responsible social conduct expressed in existing or emergent legal tendencies—and should not be adopted; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">k)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Same as (f), except that the lawyer recommends an alternative business plan that accomplishes most of the purposes of the original while also promoting the underlying spirit of the law; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">l</span>)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Though the plan conforms to the underlying purposes of the law, some regulator may disapprove it on technical grounds, and the company should not (or may not want to) take the risk of sanctions; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">m)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Because the plan complies in spirit, sanctions would be an unfair form of harassment by narrow-minded, overly-zealous regulators or opportunistic adversaries; as such, the plan should be adopted and sanctions aggressively resisted; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">n)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The plan does not comply with the law, but because the law is an unfair and misguided interference with business judgments, the lawyer will work for legal reform through the lawyer’s bar association, suggest changes to the trade association’s lobbyists in the capital, recommend nonenforcement strategies to or seek exemptions from influential administrators, etc. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">And so on.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Suppose the lawyer expresses opposition to the plan in deliberations, but is overruled. Once again, several courses of action are available to the lawyer, who might:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />acquiesce in the adverse decision at the first sign of opposition; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />press the point, using the techniques of advocacy to try to induce a change of mind; </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page609" class="pagebreak" title="609">609</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />continue to oppose the plan, carrying objections to a higher level of management or the Board; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />acquiesce, and zealously help to execute the plan; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />seek discreetly to modify the obnoxious features of the plan, perhaps by influencing middle-managers to execute it cautiously; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">f)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />insist upon recording objections, reservations, or adverse-risk assessments in Board minutes, opinion letters, or formal memos to the file; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">g)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />refuse to participate further in implementing the plan, but agree to represent the client if an adversary proceeding results; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">h)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />withdraw from the representation of that client entirely; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">i)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />whether or not the lawyer withdraws, warn that if the client goes ahead with the plan the lawyer will disclose; </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">j)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />continue to represent the client, but work through writings, bar associations, political pressure groups, public interest lobbies, advice to political candidates, influence with officials, etc., to tighten regulation of the conduct called for by the plan. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These are naturally just a tiny handful of the choices to be made regarding the form and content of advice given in the course of compliance counseling, the persons in the organization to whom such advice is given, the tactics one can resort to if one meets opposition. All these choices—except disclosure and withdrawal, which may be regulated—are well within the conventional boundaries of the counselor’s role. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Obviously most lawyers, or at least lawyers for big, powerful companies, will avoid abrasive and unnecessary confrontations with their clients. They will phrase negative advice as prudential rather than moralistic, supporting their recommendations with reasons that sound much more like statements of technical rules or empirical predictions of risks and results than political or moral judgments. . . .</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Perhaps no case has raised the question Gordon asks more pointedly than the 2001 collapse of the giant energy company, Enron, in 2001, which (as you will recall from Chapter 6’s discussion of confidentiality) was the result of a massive accounting fraud. In particular, Enron officers structured complex transactions designed to move losses off of Enron’s books and onto the books of “special purpose entities” (SPEs) created solely for the purpose of hiding Enron’s true financial condition. This was illegal. Nonetheless, Enron was able to secure the counsel of well-respected Texas law firms (Vinson &amp; Elkins and Andrews &amp; Kurth) to provide legal opinions as to the validity of some of the transactions. Specifically, it was revealed that the lawyers for Enron engaged in the following activities:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page610" class="pagebreak" title="610">610</span>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element66" />Lawyers wrote opinions certifying disguised loans to Enron as “true sales” to make it possible for Enron to report as profit what were, in fact, financial liabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element67" />Lawyers facilitated management self-dealing by not insisting on disclosure of huge management fees paid by SPEs to top Enron officials (e.g. over $30 million to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow). Lawyers asserted in SEC filings that such management agreements were negotiated at “arm’s length” and “on comparable terms” as agreements with other parties but did not seek any factual support for these patently dubious assertions.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element68" />After a vice president warned Enron’s chairman about the possibility of massive accounting fraud, Vinson &amp; Elkins agreed to conduct an investigation, although its lawyers had participated in some of the transactions at issue and the scope of its investigation was limited to exclude the accounting practices that permitted financial problems to escalate. The firm’s report warned that the “bad cosmetics” of the transactions could result in adverse publicity and litigation, but concluded that “no further investigation was necessary.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Enron’s collapse wiped out more than $1 billion in shareholder equity and caused 15,000 employees to lose their jobs, many of whom also lost their pensions. What explains the Enron lawyers’ conduct and what could they have done to counsel their client more effectively?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">It is clear that the advice both in-house lawyers and outside law firms gave to the managers of Enron and other companies like it was instrumental in enabling those managers to cream off huge profits for themselves while bringing economic ruin to investors, employees, and the taxpaying public. Although the lawyers were not principally responsible for these acts of waste and fraud, their advice was a contributing (and often necessary) cause of those acts. Such fraud could not have been carried out without the lawyers’ active approval, passive acquiescence, or failure to inquire and investigate. Nonetheless, not only the lawyers involved but large numbers of practitioners and bar committees have few or no regrets about the part they played. They vigorously justify their conduct as consistent with the highest conceptions of legal, ethical, and professional propriety, and just as vigorously resist all attempts to change the legal and ethical rules so as to increase their obligations as gatekeepers and monitors of managers’ conduct. This attitude is not universal—there are prominent corporate lawyers who dissent from it, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page611" class="pagebreak" title="611">611</span>and think the profession is failing to live up to its responsibilities; but it is pervasive.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How are we to understand why the lawyers acted as they did, and why they are justifying their actions now? Observers from outside the profession, and even some from within the profession, are tempted to say that the lawyers were simply weak and corrupt, or, for those who prefer to talk this way, that the lawyers were rational economic actors. They want the client’s business, in an intensely competitive market, and so they will wish to approve anything senior management of the client firm asks, averting their eyes from signs of trouble and their noses from the smell of fish. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But this is the amoral rational calculator’s perspective, and professionals in high-status jobs at respectable blue-chip institutions do not like to think of themselves as amoral maximizers. Like human beings everywhere who want to enjoy self-respect and the esteem of others, they tell stories about how what they do is all right, even admirable; however, some of the stories that the lawyers would like to tell were not available in this situation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">C.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">“We Din’ Know Nothin”: The Lawyer as Myopic or Limited-Function Bureaucrat</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These are claims that the lawyers were not at fault because their role was limited: We didn’t know, we weren’t informed; the accountants said the numbers were okay; management made the decisions; our representation was restricted to problems on the face of the documents or to information submitted to us.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Many of these claims of innocent ignorance now look pretty dubious. Some of the outside law firms, such as V &amp; E and Andrews &amp; Kurth, in fact worked closely with Andersen accountants in structuring many of the transactions. . . . Some of their claims of limited knowledge are plausible, however, because Enron never trusted any one set of lawyers with extensive information about its operations—it spread legal work out to over 100 law firms. . . . One question for lawyers—as well as for senior managers and board members—is whether they can conscientiously and ethically do their jobs and exercise their functions as fiduciaries in organizations structured to diffuse responsibility and prevent their access to the big picture.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">D.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">The Lawyer as Advocate</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The classic defense of the corporate lawyer’s role, both most often advanced and held in reserve if other defenses fail, is of course that we are advocates, whose duty is zealous representation of clients. We are not like auditors, who have duties to the public; our duties are only to our clients. Our job is to help them pursue their interests and put the best construction on their conduct that the law and facts will support without intolerable strain, so as to enable them to pursue any arguably-legal ends by any arguably-legal means. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page612" class="pagebreak" title="612">612</span>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">III.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />INADEQUACY OF THE EXCUSES</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Enron and similar scandals illustrate the limits of all these standard stories as adequate accounts of the corporate lawyer’s proper role. . . . It may be that a natural person cannot be compelled to internalize the values promoted by law. . . . [But] since we are free to construct the character of these artificial [corporate] persons, we should construct them for legal purposes as good citizens, persons who have internalized the public values expressed in law and the obligation to obey even laws they do not like, for the sake of the privileges of the law that generally benefits them as well as the rest of us. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">If the corporation should be constructed and presumed to have the interests of a good, law-respecting, citizen, so should its lawyers (even more so). Lawyers are not simply agents of clients—they are also licensed fiduciaries of the legal system, “part of a judicial system charged with upholding the law,” to use the ABA’s words. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[A]lthough lawyers may take on an assignment that limits the scope of their representation or asks them to accept some facts as given, they may not agree to such limits as will preclude them from competent and ethical representation. They should not, for example, agree to write an opinion certifying the legality of a deal to third parties if they have some reason to be suspicious of the facts or numbers reported to them, without doing some digging to ensure that the facts are accurate. Nor should they give assurances that certain facts are true if they have no independent means of verifying them. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The most important lessons of Enron, et al., for lawyers are the additional clouds of doubt they cast on the most common defense of the corporate lawyer’s role, and the one most often invoked by the profession in the current debates over reform. That is the corporate lawyer as adversary-advocate. The usual way in which this role is framed is that the lawyer’s loyalty runs to the client and only to the client. The lawyer must help the client realize its goals and desires, recognizing as hard limits only such legal constraints, the “bounds of the law,” as the most ingenious interpretations he can construct of fact and law that are most favorable to his client’s position. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This idea that the role of the corporate lawyer is really just like the role of the criminal defense lawyer has been criticized so often and so effectively that it always surprises me to see the idea still walking around, hale and hearty, as if nobody had ever laid a glove on it. I will quickly run through some of the strong objections to the analogy and then add another objection: The bar’s standard construction of the corporate lawyer’s role is deficient in part because it does not take the analogy seriously enough. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The most obvious objection is that legal advice given outside of adversary proceedings is not subject to any of the constraints of such proceedings. The reasons that the lawyer is given so much latitude to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page613" class="pagebreak" title="613">613</span>fight for his client in court is that the proceedings are open and public, effective mechanisms such as compelled discovery and testimony exist to bring to light suppressed inconvenient facts and make them known to adversaries and adjudicators, adversaries are present to challenge the advocate’s arguments of law and his witnesses’ and documents’ view of facts, and there is an impartial umpire or judge to rule on their sufficiency and validity. . . . Outside of such settings, one-sided advocacy is more likely to help parties overstep the line to violate the law, and to do so in such ways as are likely to evade detection and sanction, and thus frustrate the purposes of law and regulation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The point I want to add to these standard, but valuable, points is a simple one. Corporate lawyers could actually learn something useful from the role of the criminal defense lawyer. And that is that the adversary-advocate’s role—like that of all lawyers—is in large part a public role, designed to fulfill public purposes: The ascertainment of truth and the doing of justice; the protection of the autonomy, dignity and rights of witnesses and especially of the accused; and the monitoring and disciplining of police and prosecutorial conduct. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The real lesson from the defense lawyer’s or advocate’s role is simply that the [corporate] lawyer is, in addition to being a private agent of his clients, a public agent of the legal system, whose job is to help clients steer their way through the maze of the law, to bring clients’ conduct and behavior into conformity with the law—to get the client as much as possible of what the client wants without damaging the framework of the law. He may not act in furtherance of his client’s interest in ways that ultimately frustrate, sabotage, or nullify the public purposes of the laws—or that injure the interests of clients, which are hypothetically constructed, as all public corporations should be, as good citizens who internalize legal norms and wish to act in furtherance of the public values they express.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">IV.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION OF THE CORPORATE COUNSELOR’S ROLE</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The view that I am pressing here of the corporate counselor’s role is neither new nor unorthodox. It is in fact one of the traditional conceptions of the counselor’s role in our legal culture, with a pedigree quite as venerable and considerably more respectable than the rival notion of the lawyer as zealous advocate or hired gun. It was regularly invoked by leading lawyers throughout the nineteenth century and surfaced as an express ethical standard in the ABA’s first Canons of Ethics, promulgated in 1908:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Canon § 32: No client, corporate or individual, however powerful, nor any cause, civil or political, however important, is entitled to receive, nor should any lawyer render, any service or advice involving disloyalty to the law, whose ministers we are . . . or deception or betrayal of the public. . . . The lawyer . . . advances the honor of his profession and the best interests of his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page614" class="pagebreak" title="614">614</span>client when he renders service or gives advice tending to impress upon the client and his undertaking exact compliance with the strictest principles of moral law. He must also observe and advise his client to observe the statute law, though until a statute shall have been construed and interpreted by competent adjudication, he is free and entitled to advise as to its validity and as to what he conscientiously believes to be its just meaning and extent. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Since the 1970s, this conception of the wise-counselor-lawyer-statesman has been in decay. It is no longer recognized by most corporate lawyers as a norm. It has almost no institutional support in the rules and disciplinary bodies that regulate the profession. Some academic lawyers still support some version of it; and so too do some judges and regulators. It resurfaces on occasion after business disasters such as the savings-and-loan and Enron scandals. The SEC, IRS, banking regulators, and the courts have sporadically revived it and brought enforcement actions in its spirit. Bar commissions on professionalism sometimes nostalgically evoke it. Yet even where it still has some residual influence there are no effective sanctions behind it. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We cannot hope to revive the counselor’s role as the profession’s dominant role or self-conception or practical way of life. But events like the Enron collapse make one realize that the corporate counselor would still have a useful role to play, if one could revive it as one of the legal profession’s many roles, to be deployed on occasions where clients and society would be best served by independent, public-regarding legal advice. . . . I will limit my job here to trying to spell out what I think would be the essential elements of the counselor’s role. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The most basic is this: That the lawyer engaged as a counselor adopt an independent, objective view of the corporate agents’ conduct and plans and their legal validity. This emphatically does not mean that the counselor must take up an adversary stance to the client. . . . Counselors can and should be as creative as any other good lawyers in devising means to accomplish clients’ objectives that will overcome and work around legal objections, and in devising innovative arguments that will alter and expand the boundaries of the existing law. But whatever advice the counselor gives, she should: (a) Construe the facts and law of the client’s situation as a sympathetic but objective observer such as a judge, committed to serving the law’s spirit and furthering its public purposes, would construe them; (b) impute to the corporate client the character of the good citizen, who has internalized legal norms and wishes to comply with the law’s legitimate commands and purposes while pursuing its own interests and goals; and (c) be based on an interpretation and practical application of the law to the client’s situation that helps the client, so constructed, to satisfy rather than subvert the purposes of the law. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When the counselor asserts facts or makes a legal claim or argument to authorities or third parties—outside the context of fully adversary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page615" class="pagebreak" title="615">615</span>proceedings where all interested parties have effective access to relevant facts and legal knowledge necessary to forming the opinion—they should generally be facts and arguments that a fair-minded and fully-informed observer could accept as plausible and correct. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">If the counselor perceives that her services have been or are being used to further, or even just to facilitate by providing plausible cover for, corporate strategies that could not be justified to a fully-informed objective observer as conforming to the letter, spirit, and public purposes of the law, she has to take steps to correct the problem and to try to bring the client’s agents back into compliance. This means that if she has suspicions she should investigate them; if not satisfied, she should bring the problem to the general counsel, CEO, and if necessary, the board of directors to insist on compliance; and if corrective steps are not taken, she must resign. Finally, if serious damage to outside interests may result from the agents’ misconduct, she must signal the problem to people such as regulatory authorities who could prevent it.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I can already hear the cries of protest: “But this is not the lawyer’s role!” The obvious answer to that is, yes, I know that it is not the lawyer’s role as most corporate lawyers and the bar now see that role; but that is precisely the problem that the savings-and-loan and Enron, etc. scandals have suggested needs to be solved. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[T]he full-scale version of my proposal would have to contain at least two more components. First, there should be government mandates that for some representations and transactions, corporations must hire lawyers who have undertaken the role and accompanying obligation of counselors. For example: lawyers certifying compliance with laws, regulations, orders, consent decrees, or reporting requirements of official agencies; lawyers giving opinions to satisfy disclosure requirements or filing proxy statements under the securities laws; and lawyers giving opinions on conformity with tax laws on tax-minimization devices. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, there should be effective institutionalization of and support for the counselor’s role, incentives to perform it, and sanctions for breaches. . . . Obviously, [lawyers] would be subject to special regimes of judicial enforcement, civil liability, and malpractice; and, where practicing before agencies such as the SEC or IRS, to administrative discipline. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the defense that Vinson &amp; Elkins offered of its conduct in Enron: “When clients ask us [if they can do something] our job is to . . . figure out if there is a legally appropriate way to do it. That’s what we do. And so does every other law firm in America.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1343" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1343" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span> Is that vision consistent with the Model Rules? Is it ethical? What would Robert Gordon say?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page616" class="pagebreak" title="616">616</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What other factors might account for lawyers’ involvement in ethically problematic transactions? In 2000, Enron was Vinson &amp; Elkin’s largest client and a frequent source of lateral employment for its attorneys. The firm billed the company between $27 and $30 million in services, almost two dozen of its lawyers had obtained jobs with Enron since 1991, and Enron’s general counsel and deputy general counsel were both former Vinson &amp; Elkin partners.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1344" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1344" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> If this revolving door is a problem, what is the solution?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In many cases like Enron, problems are exacerbated by law firms’ eat-what-you-kill compensation structures that tie individual partners’ financial and professional status to their client billings. When lawyers believe that a client will readily find some other firm to push the envelope, they may see little point in withholding assistance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1345" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1345" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span> Are there measures that firms, bar associations, or legislators could take?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although Enron’s top management were convicted of fraud and conspiracies, their lawyers were never officially punished. However, in 2006, Vinson &amp; Elkins did agree to pay $30 million to Enron’s bankruptcy estate in exchange for relinquishment of any claims that it had aided and abetted fraud that contributed to the company’s collapse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1346" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1346" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span> Do you think the $30 million payment was justified? Was it sufficient?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Geoffrey Hazard writes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Many courses of action taken by a client are “wrong” at least in the exacting sense that they are not what would be done by a supremely moral person unconcerned with costs. If this were the standard by which a lawyer should judge whether to continue his association with a client, there would be few of either clients or lawyers.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">In recent years, some critics of the legal profession have suggested that a lawyer for a corporation is responsible for its conduct in at least two related respects: his advice to such a client should consist not merely of what the client legally might do but also of what the client morally ought to do; and he should not serve a client who is not disposed to follow advice of that character. . . . It is perfectly possible to think that the lawyer for the criminal accused is not “responsible” for him, while at the same time thinking that the general counsel for a corporation or agency is, in some sense of the word, “responsible” for it. The point is made by suggesting that it is one thing to represent a sometime murderer, quite another to be on retainer to the Mafia. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The obvious answer for the adviser whose advice is ignored is that he can resign. In some circumstances that is the only honorable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page617" class="pagebreak" title="617">617</span>course to be followed, but it is impractical as a response to all except fundamental disagreements. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">There are situations in which it seems proper that the client should suffer that kind of penalty, for example if he insists on fabricating evidence or carrying out a swindle. But if the case is less extreme than this, the sanction of resignation is too severe. It implies that the client should have to function without proper guidance, or perhaps cease functioning at all, because its managers do not see fit to follow the advice of its advisers.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If this were the consequence that should ensue from a client’s refusal to follow advice, it would mean that the advice was in effect peremptory—not an informed suggestion but a command. When an adviser’s advice is in effect peremptory, however, the result is a reversal of the underlying structure of responsibility for the organization’s conduct. The adviser becomes the ultimate arbiter and the client a subordinate.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1347" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1347" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">How do you think Hazard would evaluate the Enron lawyers’ actions? How does Hazard’s vision of the corporate lawyer as counsel differ from that articulated by Gordon above? Whose position do you find more persuasive?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Wharton Business School professor Scott Armstrong gave groups of executives a hypothetical situation facing a pharmaceutical company’s board of directors. In the hypothetical, one of the company’s most profitable drugs, which accounts for 12 percent of the company’s profits, is found to cause between fourteen and twenty-two unnecessary deaths a year. Unless the company puts up a fight against regulatory action, the drug is likely to be banned by regulators since a competitor offers a safe alternative.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Faced with these facts, Armstrong found that 80 percent of executives decided to continue marketing the product. They also opted to take legal and political action to fight the potential ban. But when individuals with similar backgrounds were asked for their personal views on the same hypothetical, 97 percent believed that continuing to market the drug was irresponsible.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1348" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1348" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> What, if anything, does this case study reveal? When lawyers observe such dynamics in a client organization, how should they respond?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861597" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219140" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756548" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908681" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 4</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You are a litigation partner in a small Midwestern law firm. One of the firm’s major clients manufactures a profitable chemical solvent that is currently under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Certain recently published data, as well as your client’s own preliminary studies, suggest that prolonged contact with the solvent during manufacture or use may slightly increase the risks of cancer and birth defects among exposed workers. Total elimination of these risks would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page618" class="pagebreak" title="618">618</span>be prohibitively expensive. Less toxic substitutes for the solvent are available from competing firms, but at substantially higher costs.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Government data also indicate that improper disposal of the product after use could create hazards if significant amounts of the product enter the groundwater. Current EPA standards prohibit discharges above .50 grams per liter of effluent. Compliance with that standard is quite expensive. You know from informal sources that violations of .75 or less are largely ignored because of the EPA’s limited enforcement budget and that inspections are relatively rare in the rural areas where your client’s plants are located. Furthermore, EPA officials typically issue a warning before applying sanctions unless the violation is extreme (more than 1.5 grams per liter). Your preliminary investigation reveals that some of the client’s plants routinely release the solvent at levels between .75 and 1.00 grams per liter.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1349" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1349" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In your judgment, the client has a non-frivolous but unconvincing argument that continued manufacture and sale of the solvent is lawful under prevailing standards. You also believe that those standards should, and soon will be, strengthened. However, by pursuing all procedural opportunities, your firm could probably delay application of any standards banning domestic manufacture and sale of the solvent for several years. Even after that point, the company could continue to export stockpiled inventory to developing countries with less rigorous safeguards, which need such materials at the lowest possible cost.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although you oppose continued manufacture or export, neither the other partner working on the case nor the company’s top executives share your view. As they point out, the manufacturer’s major plant is the mainstay of the local economy and closure would cause severe financial difficulties for the entire community. In their view, employees’ risks of cancer are no greater than in many other occupational contexts. Since much of the data on carcinogenic effects are now publicly available, the CEO believes workers should make their own choices about whether to continue employment. Similarly, most of the company’s senior managers are convinced that foreign countries should be free to adopt whatever tradeoffs between environmental and economic values they deem advisable. According to the CEO, attempts to impose American standards are a form of cultural imperialism.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume that you believe a neutral tribunal would find that continued domestic manufacture of the solvent is unlawful under existing statutory standards. If the company’s in-house counsel disagrees, what are your counseling obligations?</p>

You are also convinced that exporting the solvent to countries without adequate environmental regulation is morally indefensible. How should you proceed?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume that the company’s Board ratifies management’s decision to continue domestic manufacture and export while the matter is under EPA and OSHA review. About 15 percent of your firm’s litigation profits come from representing this client on a variety of matters. Other partners in your firm strongly oppose withdrawal of representation on the EPA and OSHA cases since it would antagonize management without affecting corporate policy. If you continue to find the client’s position objectionable, what is your response?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should you inform your client about what you know concerning the EPA’s enforcement of the discharge limit? What if you believe that such information might persuade plant managers to continue, or to begin discharging, effluents above the 0.50 limit? Would it matter why enforcement was lax in rural areas and whether EPA practices were widely known in the industry? Suppose the .50 discharge limit was set with urban areas in mind, where the mix of other pollutants and the density of population made the harms from contaminated discharge more serious than in rural areas. Alternatively, suppose that the less frequent sanctions in those areas reflected insufficient agency resources and the greater expense involved in testing at rural sites.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What if you are unsure about the reasons for the EPA’s enforcement policy? Does competent representation always require providing clients with information about the likelihood and severity of sanctions?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1350" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1350" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span></p>

Without lining, waste pits leak into surrounding water tables, and their discharge combines with other spills and byproduct dumping. The result is to contaminate local rivers on which thousands of people depend. The contamination kills fish, animal, and plant life for hundreds of miles, and causes health problems to humans, including higher risks of miscarriages, birth defects, and cancer.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1351" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1351" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span> What were the ethical responsibilities of lawyers for the company who were aware of the dangers? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You work as an in-house lawyer for Uber. The General Counsel has asked for a memo concerning the legal and ethical ramifications of the company’s failure to comply with local laws governing taxi and car services. Uber’s leadership has taken the position that it is not operating such services but merely providing an app that facilitates matching independent contractor drivers and would-be customers. By failing to comply with expensive regulations concerning matters such as insurance, vehicle inspections, and driver background checks, the company has quickly become the most cost-effective provider in many jurisdictions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The General Counsel also believes that the local laws that Uber violates are outdated, infrequently and inconsistently enforced, and in need of modification to accommodate the company’s business model. By building a large customer base through providing non-compliant services, the company hopes to force changes that will benefit the public as well as itself and similar providers. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One particularly controversial issue involves a strategy that Uber has used to evade law enforcement officials who are posing as customers to gain evidence of the company’s illegal activities. In response to such enforcement efforts, the company has devised a “Greyball” program, which identifies such customers and then scrambles a fake version of the app showing nonexistent “ghost cars” or indicates that no cars are available. Drivers who pick up such a customer receive instructions to immediately terminate the ride. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You have identified the criminal penalties that Uber faces by operating in violation of local regulatory ordinances, as well as potential obstruction of justice charges and violation of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. You are somewhat worried in-house lawyers could be in violation of Model Rule 1.2(d), which provides that a “lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.” How would you assess that risk, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page621" class="pagebreak" title="621">621</span>and what strategies might you advise to avoid potential disciplinary liability? </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2019, Uber had begun operating in more than seventy countries and was the most valuable private start-up company in the world, with a valuation close to $120 billion dollars.<a id="_Ref31560474" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1355" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1355" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> It has also been subject to an exceptional range of criminal investigations and prosecutions involving not only its business model and evasion of law enforcement, but also its workplace culture. After a series of allegations involving gender discrimination and harassment, its founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, was forced to resign.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1356" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1356" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Many commentators believe that the company’s defiance of local laws to establish its business model encouraged a “fundamental illegality” that led to other violations less easily justified.<a id="_Ref31560462" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1357" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1357" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> The Greyball program may be an example. It was originally designed to protect drivers in countries where they faced attacks by local taxi workers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1358" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1358" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span> It then became a tool to evade domestic law enforcement. Writing in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Harvard Business Review</span>, Benjamin Edelman argues: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[H]aving grown through intentional illegality, Uber can’t easily pivot toward following the rules. . . . Uber’s lawyers were complicit in building a culture of illegality. . . . [Its] legal team, led by [its] Chief Legal Officer . . . approved its Greyball software. . . . Having built a corporate culture that celebrates breaking the law, it is surely no accident that Uber then faced scandal after scandal. How is an Uber manager to know which laws should be followed and which ignored? . . . It is tempting to discard [legal] requirements when a company brings radically improved services, as many feel Uber did. But in declining to enforce clear-cut rules like commercial vehicle licensing, we reward lawbreaking and all its unsavory consequences. Uber’s well-publicized shortcomings show all too clearly why we ought not do so.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1359" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1359" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you agree? If so, what follows for legal counsel? Should they be subject to discipline for violations of Rule 1.2? What is their best defense against such charges? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Charles Yablon situates the Uber issue in the broader context of what he calls counseling “disruptive businesses,” namely those that violate the law <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page622" class="pagebreak" title="622">622</span>in the hopes of ultimately changing it.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1360" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section20.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1360" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> Other examples that he discusses include Airbnb and marijuana producers and sellers. He advocates changes to Rule 1.2(d) that would allow lawyers to “advise or assist clients with respect to conduct that may appear as possibly criminal, if objective evidence creates a reasonable belief that such conduct is likely to be permitted in the foreseeable future.” This requirement could be satisfied by lawyers receiving a “determination that such proposed conduct is not harmful or otherwise immoral from an independent committee of the client’s board.” Would you support such a change to Rule 1.2(d)? Is an independent committee likely to be truly “objective?” Can you identify a preferable approach for “disruptive businesses”? Is this a context where Preet Bharara’s warnings about walking in a “culture of minimalism” are relevant? If so, what follows?</p>
