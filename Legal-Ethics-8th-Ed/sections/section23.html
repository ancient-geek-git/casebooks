      <p class="TextParagraph">Much of the early impetus for bar ethical codes arose from concerns about lawyers’ marketing practices. The readings that follow explore these concerns in the context of current rules and policies. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The standard justification for bar regulation rests on the assumption that imperfections in the market for legal services justify external oversight, which the bar is best positioned to carry out. Such imperfections include what economists variously describe as information barriers, adverse selection, free riders, and externalities.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Information Barriers</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An initial difficulty stems from many legal consumers’ inability to evaluate the services they receive, even after purchase. Economists agree that legal services are “credence goods.” Unlike “search” or “experience” goods, where a good’s quality is easily and accurately ascertained either before or after purchase, consumers of credence goods cannot easily judge the quality of the good or service they have purchased—even <span style="font-style: italic;">ex post</span>.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1658" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1658" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Adding to the difficulty, most individual (as opposed to business) clients are one-shot purchasers. Most Americans consult a lawyer only twice in their lifetime, and few Americans consult the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> attorney more than once.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1659" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1659" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>This lack of experience, coupled with the expense and difficulty of comparative shopping for professional services (a point we discuss below), makes it unbelievably difficult for consumers to identify competent and cost-effective practitioners.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1660" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1660" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Exemplifying these dynamics, in a survey by Yankelovich Partners for Martindale-Hubbell, three-quarters of consumers indicated that, when choosing a lawyer, it was hard to know who to trust; 44 percent agreed that it was hard to find a good lawyer; and 28 percent reported that their inability to compare information about different attorneys would limit their ability to research options for representation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1661" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1661" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> In another survey, 11 percent of Americans reported a situation in which they considered hiring an attorney but did not do so because they did not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page756" class="pagebreak" title="756">756</span>know how to find an acceptable practitioner.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1662" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1662" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> This all means that, in the absence of some external regulation, too many purchasers may end up with incompetent, overpriced, or unethical practitioners.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Adverse Selection</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A related problem involves the adverse effects of information barriers on the quality of professional services. If clients cannot accurately discriminate among the services available, and no regulatory body enforces minimum standards, lawyers will lack adequate incentives to invest time, effort, and resources in providing quality services. Competition may encourage attorneys to cut corners, and, over time, a “market for lemons” may develop, in which bad lawyering drives out good lawyering, while the public pays the price.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1663" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1663" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Free Riders</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An additional difficulty involves “free riders”: those who gain from bar standards without personally respecting them. For example, the bar collectively has an interest in securing the public’s trust and in having lawyers conduct themselves in a way that maintains that trust. However, absent effective regulatory structures, individual attorneys will have inadequate economic incentives to avoid cheating. They can benefit as free riders from the bar’s general reputation without personally adhering to the rules that maintain it.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Externalities</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A dynamic involves external costs to society and third parties from conduct that may be advantageous to particular clients and their lawyers. The public generally has an interest in the prompt and just resolution of disputes, even though individual clients might prefer that their own lawyers delay or obstruct truth-finding processes. </p>
      <p style="line-height: 12.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Upshot</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although the above analysis calls for <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> regulation, there is no comparable consensus about the form it should take or who should design the governance structure. The following materials explore such disputes concerning lawyers’ advertising, solicitation, specialization, group services, and fee arrangements.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc335223725" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732577" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733107" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733516" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369052" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369460" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486667" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487076" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861654" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922300" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219208" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756610" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908281" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908744" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Advertising</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers are permitted to advertise per Rule 7.2. This rule provides that lawyers “may communicate information regarding the lawyer’s services through any media” provided that “[a]ny [advertising] communication . . . must include the name and contact information of at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page757" class="pagebreak" title="757">757</span>least one lawyer . . . responsible for its content.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1664" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1664" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> Companion Rule 7.1 further admonishes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lawyer shall not make a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services. A communication is false or misleading if it contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861655" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219209" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756611" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908745" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />History of Advertising Rules</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Attorney advertising is now widely permitted—and interestingly, attorney advertising was also widely permissible far back in time. Practitioners in ancient Rome, for example, employed various techniques for self-promotion. Some hawked their services on the street, while others hired clappers to applaud presentations before judges.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1665" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1665" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span> Similarly, throughout most of the nineteenth century in the United States, advertising in circulars and newspapers was common. Self-promotion was not infrequent among even the most distinguished attorneys, including Abraham Lincoln and David Hoffman, the author of one of the first ethical treatises (<span style="font-style: italic;">Fifty Resolutions in Regard to Professional Deportment</span>). Indeed, even the first state ethical code (Alabama, 1887) explicitly permitted newspaper advertisements that did not involve “laudation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1666" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1666" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, after the turn of the century, bar leaders became increasingly concerned about commercial practices—motivated, in part, by a desire among elite lawyers to clamp down on the practices of a new wave of immigrant lawyers, who were prone to advertise. The ABA’s 1908 Canons of Ethics reflected this concern and banned attorney advertisements, declaring that they “def[ied] the traditions and lower[ed] the tone of our high calling and [were] intolerable.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1667" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1667" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> Or, in the tart words of George Sharswood, a prominent early ethics commentator, “business [should] seek the young attorney,” rather than the converse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1668" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1668" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When enacted in 1969, the Model Code retained the Canon’s prohibition, barring “any form of public communication that contains professionally self-laudatory statements calculated to attract lay clients.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1669" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1669" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> For decades, in fact, legal ethics committees spent more time refining and enforcing restrictions on advertising and solicitation than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page758" class="pagebreak" title="758">758</span>they devoted to any other subject.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1670" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1670" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> During the mid-1900s, few forms of self-promotion, however insignificant, escaped the concern of the bar. Courts and committees condemned practices such as distributing embossed matchbooks, sending Christmas cards with a lawyer’s name and profession, using neon lighting or ostentatious lettering in law office signs, endorsing a particular brand of Scotch, wearing jewelry with the state bar insignia, and using boldface type in telephone books.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1671" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1671" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The seemingly trivial preoccupations of some ethics opinions should not obscure the serious concerns at issue. To leaders of the organized bar, the prohibitions on advertising (and its close cousin, solicitation) expressed the bedrock belief that law was a profession rather than a business. From their perspective, allowing overt self-promotion would erode professionalism, invite deception, and “lower the whole tone of the administration of justice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1672" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1672" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, a growing constituency both inside and outside the profession began to challenge those assumptions. The increasing diversity of the profession, the rise of the consumer movement, the emergence of low-cost legal clinics, and the growth of concerns about unmet legal needs helped fuel criticism about the bar’s anticompetitive policies. Many commentators viewed policies prohibiting advertising as anachronistic, as they seemed to be premised on the model of a small-town legal practice in which people commonly knew lawyers’ reputations and the cost and quality of their services. Such assumptions were out of step with contemporary, urban realities. In addition, critics objected to the elitist biases underpinning bar policy. Lawyers representing wealthy individuals and corporations had various opportunities for genteel promotion; their firms often subsidized memberships in private clubs and purchased listings in bar-approved law directories available to major businesses. By contrast, attorneys representing poor and middle-income individuals had fewer chances to publicize their services, and their potential clients were less likely to have adequate sources of information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1673" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1673" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These concerns set the stage for the landmark legal case, <a id="dabmci_7256234ff0f646579546976f47b91512" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Bates v.

State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350 (1977)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Bates v. State Bar of Arizona</span>, 433 U.S. 350 (1977), which led to the elimination of the bar’s longstanding restrictions on advertising. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> involved a low-cost legal clinic—a new kind of law firm developed in the early 1970s that offered simple, no-frills legal services to a mostly middle-income clientele. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates </span>petitioners, John Bates and Van O’Steen, were young, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page759" class="pagebreak" title="759">759</span>idealistic law graduates who founded a legal clinic in Phoenix, Arizona in 1974 to offer inexpensive assistance on routine legal matters, such as divorces, adoptions, and name changes. But soon after its founding, the firm faced dwindling revenue. Bates and O’Steen recognized that they would need to advertise in order for their low-fee, high-volume clinic practice to succeed. As O’Steen ultimately testified: “I don’t mind confessing to you that this has not been a terribly profitable operation up to this point, but we think it can be made profitable [if we are permitted to advertise] . . . and if that doesn’t happen this clinic concept will not survive.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1674" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1674" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> So, advertise they did, with a somewhat colorless advertisement in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Arizona Republic</span> touting “legal services at very reasonable fees” and listing charges for certain routine services such as uncontested divorces ($175), adoptions ($225), and simple personal bankruptcies ($250).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Though the advertisement was hardly flashy, it did run afoul of Arizona Disciplinary Rule 2–101(B), which at the time provided that “[a] lawyer shall not publicize himself . . . through newspaper . . . advertisements.” Accordingly, Bates and O’Steen were quickly and predictably disciplined, and they ultimately appealed the disciplinary decision to the Supreme Court. In 1977, the Supreme Court held in a five-to-four opinion that lawyer advertising could not be subjected to blanket suppression and that the advertisement at issue deserved First Amendment protection.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In a subsequent decision five years later, <a id="dabmci_5dd4edbf07484addb5dbd2771ad28af1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;R.M.J., In re&quot; \s &quot;A;O;12;dabmci_5dd4edbf07484addb5dbd2771ad28af1_1;I178f0b3b9c1f11d993e6d35cc61aab4a;;0;F;In re R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191, 203 (1982)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">In re R.M.J.</span>, 455 U.S. 191, 203 (1982), the Court again struck down content restrictions on non-misleading commercial speech.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1675" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1675" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span> In the years since, numerous attorney advertising cases have reached the Supreme Court, and the Court has fleshed out the contours of what is and is not permissible.

      <p class="TextParagraph">All these decisions have provoked strong dissents within the Court and widespread opposition within the bar. According to the chair of the ABA’s Commission on Advertising, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> and its resulting reforms were “about as popular with the legal profession as venereal disease.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1679" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1679" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> Surveys in the two decades following <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> generally found that most lawyers opposed mass media advertising and that many practitioners agreed with former Chief Justice Warren Burger that such self-promotion was one of the most “unethical things a lawyer can do.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1680" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1680" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> By contrast, according to most surveys, the majority of nonlawyer consumers agreed that mass media advertising was professionally acceptable.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1681" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1681" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although the bar has proved increasingly receptive to marketing, the number of practitioners who advertise “intensively” has remained small. The ABA estimates that only about 2 percent of the nation’s attorneys advertise on television and only about 5 percent advertise on the radio. Rather than mass marketing, most law firms rely on more indirect business development strategies, such as press releases, promotional literature, special events, client education seminars, websites, and yellow pages listings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1682" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1682" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics raise four main objections to attorney ads. Attorney advertising, they contend, will deceive clients, increase costs, foment litigation, and erode the stature and dignity of the profession. Each critique is addressed in turn.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">First, some worry that attorney ads are inevitably misleading because legal services are inherently individualized—meaning any ad is likely to confuse, rather than inform, the consumer. In <a id="dabmci_61691a9cfdff4f538a4a615864d85e87" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, the majority acknowledged the force of this objection but felt that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page761" class="pagebreak" title="761">761</span>preferred remedy was “more disclosure, rather than less.” <a id="dabmci_7a381b8ccc58429f82255d46289515d5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;" class="FootnoteReference">433 U.S. at</span> 375. Advertising, the Court agreed, “does not provide a complete foundation on which to select an attorney. But it seems peculiar to deny the consumer, on the ground that the information is incomplete, at least some of the relevant information needed to reach an informed decision.” <a id="dabmci_89282622c15a4e5f96caf1910112fae2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 374.<span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Further, the Court advised: “If the naiveté of the public will cause advertising by attorneys to be misleading, then it is the bar’s role to assure that the populace is sufficiently informed as to enable it to place advertising in its proper perspective.” <a id="dabmci_5a7379c3955c49c6a958f76da12b90c8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 375.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, opponents of advertising claim that ads raise the price of legal services because they increase overhead costs, and these costs may be passed along to consumers. The Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> considered this argument but rejected it as empirically “dubious.” <a id="dabmci_64d32c637e7547188ad804f83034c025" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 377. The majority pointed out that advertising—particularly price advertising, as seen in the legal clinic ad at issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>—tends to <span style="font-style: italic;">promote</span> price competition, and economists broadly agree that price competition generally results in lower fees for the consumer.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the decades since <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, significant evidence supports the Supreme Court’s rosy view. Empirical research, including a rigorous Federal Trade Commission study, suggests that advertising has lowered the price of routine legal services—though, as discussed below, personal injury lawyers’ contingency fees seem to buck this salutary trend.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1683" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1683" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Third, critics claim that advertising may affect litigation behavior and induce more individuals to hire lawyers and file claims. In <a id="dabmci_e4bd7fffc53747d19950b703952f2770" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> itself, the Court acknowledged this possibility but refused to condemn advertising on this basis: “Although advertising might increase the use of the judicial machinery, we cannot accept the notion that it is always better for a person to suffer a wrong silently than to redress it by legal action.” <a id="dabmci_f88d7dbe46fa48eca6b97aff79eb8422" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;" class="FootnoteReference">Bates</span><span style="font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;" class="FootnoteReference">, 433 U.S. at 37</span>6<span style="font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;" class="FootnoteReference">.</span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, critics charge that advertising will erode respect for lawyers and tarnish the profession’s public image. In <a id="dabmci_3cd766147053486f9b35878c98adb769" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, however, the Court questioned that premise: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. In fact, it has been suggested that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession. The absence of advertising may be seen to reflect the profession’s failure to reach out and serve the community: Studies reveal that many persons do not obtain counsel even when they perceive a need because of the feared price of services or because of an inability to locate a competent attorney. Indeed, cynicism with regard to the profession may be created by the fact that it long has publicly eschewed advertising, while condoning the actions of the attorney who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page762" class="pagebreak" title="762">762</span>structures his social or civic associations so as to provide contacts with potential clients.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush"><a id="dabmci_1c72bb8246fa45c6b8850aca490d7dda" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 369–71. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Zauderer</span> (mentioned earlier as a case where the Court permitted advertising), the Court added:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[W]e are unsure that the State’s desire that attorneys maintain their dignity in their communications with the public is an interest substantial enough to justify the abridgment of their First Amendment rights. . . . [T]he mere possibility that some members of the population might find advertising embarrassing or offensive cannot justify suppressing it.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <a id="dabmci_37beaddeae1a4884b6eabb949d049911" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">471 U.S. at 648</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Evidence on the effects of advertising on the profession is mixed. Some studies have found adverse effects from attorney advertising. In one survey, consumers who were aware of lawyers’ ads rated the profession lower on characteristics such as trustworthiness, professionalism, honesty, and integrity.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1684" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1684" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> In another, exposure to certain crass advertisements “heightened pre-existing biases that jury awards are too high, [that] justice can be ‘bought and sold,’ [and] that most lawyers will help clients win ‘even if they know they are lying.<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1685" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1685" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Another study found that almost 90 percent of surveyed ABA members believed that advertising harms the profession’s image.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1686" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1686" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> Other research, however, indicates that “dignified” advertisements reflect favorably on the profession and on the attorneys who advertise.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1687" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1687" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> One study of Gallup poll data suggested that advertising may actually raise the image of lawyers by shedding the “elitist” image of lawyers and increasing access to legal representation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1688" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1688" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Or advertising may not have much of an effect at all: A comprehensive review of research by the ABA’s Commission on Advertising found no convincing evidence that legal advertising significantly affects public attitudes about lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1689" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1689" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc335223727" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732580" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733518" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369462" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487078" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861664" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219211" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756613" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908747" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Under Rules <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 7.1&quot; \s &quot;7.1&quot; \c 16 " />7.1 and <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 7.2&quot; \s &quot;7.2&quot; \c 16 " />7.2, attorney advertisements are generally permitted unless they are “false or misleading.” Comments to Rule 7.1 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page763" class="pagebreak" title="763">763</span>further clarify: “A truthful statement is . . . misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation.”<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,Times,Baskerville,Georgia,serif;" class="CommentReference"> </span>It further provides that “an unsubstantiated comparison of the lawyer’s services or fees with the services or fees of other lawyers may be misleading if presented with such specificity as would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the comparison can be substantiated.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1690" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1690" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Even with that guidance, the “false or misleading” standard can be tough to apply. By whose standard should the bar evaluate whether lawyers’ representations are misleading? It appears that lawyers ought to use a “reasonable person” standard, but how much knowledge of legal services does the “reasonable person” possess? How tolerant is the “reasonable person” of “puffery”? What kind of evidence is necessary to show that consumers are or might be misled? How does the research cited earlier in this Chapter about the difficulty consumers have when shopping for lawyers influence your answers?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you evaluate advertising that highlights an attorney’s designation as a “Super Lawyer” by a commercial rating service? <span style="font-style: italic;">Super Lawyers</span> is a magazine or a magazine supplement that claims to base its ratings on “a patented multiphase selection process.” Lawyers who are chosen are encouraged to purchase advertisements in the magazine or supplement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1691" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1691" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Some suggest that these “self-aggrandizing titles,” which cannot be objectively verified, ought to be restricted because they may “lead an unwary consumer to believe that the lawyers so described are . . . superior to their colleagues who practice in the same area of law.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1692" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1692" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> Others accept such “Super Lawyer” designations, sometimes subject to specified conditions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1693" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1693" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> What approach would you support?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 7.2 currently errs on the side of permitting attorney advertising, even if the advertising is patently undignified. Some suggest that Rule 7.2’s approach is too lax and that ads should be more carefully scrutinized. How should the bar’s concern about maintaining its public image be weighed against the benefits of unrestricted speech? In a nation where the average consumer receives close to a thousand messages a day, are tasteless but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page764" class="pagebreak" title="764">764</span>attention-grabbing ads justified? Or does the legal profession have a legitimate—or even compelling—interest in preventing a race to the bottom? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another one of Rule 7.2’s provisions regulates attorney referrals. Rule 7.2(b) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not compensate, give or promise anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services except that a lawyer may,” among other things:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant to an agreement . . . that provides for the other person to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(i)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0.9pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(ii)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client is informed of the existence and nature of the agreement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1694" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1694" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Certain personal injury law firms enter into these reciprocal relationships with physicians or chiropractors, whereby the law firm refers clients to the physician/chiropractor for medical care, and the physician/chiropractor refers patients (who were harmed in auto accidents or on-the-job, for instance) to the personal injury law firm for legal help. Are these relationships ethical? Does Rule 7.2’s requirement that the client be informed resolve any concerns you might have with these arrangements?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Professor Nora Freeman Engstrom highlights a dark side of attorney advertising. She notes that most lawyers who now aggressively advertise their services are not legal clinic lawyers, like John Bates and Van O’Steen. Instead, they are personal injury lawyers. She writes:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Most personal injury attorneys, it appears, advertise, and most of the biggest advertisers are personal injury lawyers. Indeed, PI lawyers are, and have long been, the dominant TV advertisers. They are, and have long been, the dominant Yellow Pages advertisers. And, according to the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>, of the top ten spenders on legal advertising (of all types), <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> are personal injury or plaintiff-related law firms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1695" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1695" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Engstrom further observes that these personal injury lawyers charge contingency fees, and there is some evidence that they charge <span style="font-style: italic;">higher</span> contingency fees (on a percentage basis) than their non-advertising counterparts, even though there is scant evidence that they offer superior services. Worse, the public—particularly low-income Americans, who are most likely to hire lawyers based on attorney ads—may labor under serious misconceptions. She elaborates:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">There is some evidence that prospective clients overestimate attorney advertisers’ quality. Notably, a 1992 New Mexico survey, specifically studying the public’s perception of direct-mail advertisers, found that some survey respondents (namely, those who were poor and less-educated) believed that attorney advertisers were of higher quality than non-advertisers and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page765" class="pagebreak" title="765">765</span>inclined to give a better deal. Some respondents also overestimated the stringency of regulations that govern attorney advertisements. Namely, 77% of the least educated respondents [falsely] believed that advertising lawyers are legally required to be “experienced in the trial” of cases in the substantive area in which they advertise. A 1990 Nevada survey found much the same. Of those who had not completed high school, 67% of respondents incorrectly believed “that lawyers who advertise for certain types of cases necessarily have specialized knowledge, training, and skills in handling those types of cases.” It is well established that less affluent, less educated individuals are the individuals most apt to select a lawyer on the basis of attorney advertising. If, as these two Bar-sponsored surveys suggest, clients who pick advertising lawyers <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> that choosing an advertiser includes some experience or quality guarantee, that might at least partially explain [why advertising lawyers appear to charge more, for a similar or even shoddier service].<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1696" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1696" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Does the above information affect your view concerning the propriety of attorney advertising? Consider the information above as you read about settlement mills below in Section F.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How strictly should lawyer advertising be monitored? Recent research suggests that bar regulations governing attorney ads are grossly under-enforced. Since <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, surveyed jurisdictions have averaged fewer than one reported disciplinary case per year for advertising violations.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1697" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1697" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> Formal enforcement actions are rare even in states that, on paper, have a strict regulatory stance toward advertising—and even in jurisdictions where non-compliance is common.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1698" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1698" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> For example, Engstrom’s article above included a study of Yellow Pages ads from thirteen cities, including Las Vegas. Of the Las Vegas ads she reviewed, she found a variety of questionable boasts, including: “GET THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE SETTLEMENT,” “MAXIMUM RECOVERY,” “MAXIMUM LEGAL POWER,” “More experience in the courtroom,” “Exceptional Lawyers,” “WE ARE THE BEST,” and “Nevada’s Premier Injury Firm.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1699" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1699" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> Nevada’s ethics rules forbid lawyers from making “false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services” and provide that a “communication is false or misleading if it . . . (c) Compares the lawyer’s services with other lawyers’ service, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1700" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1700" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> Could <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">ever</span> “factually substantiate” his claim that he will secure for a client the “maximum possible settlement”? Why or why not?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page766" class="pagebreak" title="766">766</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Disciplinary authorities’ reluctance to discipline lawyers for noncompliance may stem from a variety of sources, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element96" />a lack of resources to proactively uncover violations;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element97" />a lack of client complaints and demonstrable harm from violations;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does the high visibility of unsanctioned rule violations raise concern? According to some commentators, a refusal to enforce ethical standards erodes respect for bar regulatory processes and shields judgments about commercial speech from open debate and review. At the very least, these commentators argue, disciplinary authorities should define and defend their enforcement policies and bring formal rules in line with actual practices. Do you agree? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Internet advertising poses a particular enforcement challenge, as bar personnel are hamstrung by a combination of inadequate resources, ambiguity in the application of ethical standards to electronic communication, and an arguable lack of authority over out-of-state conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1701" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1701" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> States’ recent attempts to regulate keyword advertising illustrate the novel challenges posed by the internet. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Google and other search providers allow advertisers to bid on keywords and phrases. The winning bidder’s advertisements are then displayed above the search results when a searcher uses the purchased term. Somewhat dubiously, however, some lawyers have purchased keywords associated with the names and practices of their <span style="font-style: italic;">competitors</span>. In September 2018, for example, a Florida lawyer named Alex Hanna complained to the Florida Bar that a <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span> lawyer in the same practice area (DUI and traffic ticket defense) had purchased the phrase “alex hanna” and placed advertisements making use of Hanna’s name. Some clients were apparently confused by the ploy. One disgruntled client, for example, complained that he “was under the impression that he had retained Alex Hanna’s Law Firm and only realized he was being represented by another firm [the Ticket Clinic] when he called Alex Hanna’s Law Firm to check on the status of his case.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1702" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1702" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> Should such competitive conduct be permissible? How should states respond?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1703" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1703" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Recall that, back in the 1970s, the interest in attorney advertising was partially fueled by the concern that consumers needed attorney ads to identify competent practitioners. Today, more than four decades after the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> decision, that concern persists. Many consumers who are “one shot” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page767" class="pagebreak" title="767">767</span>purchasers of legal services <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> lack adequate, reliable, and objective sources of information concerning lawyer qualifications, track records, and competence, and, in surveys, Americans continue to express a desire for more and better information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1704" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1704" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The limited objective, verifiable information that is available about lawyers is particularly noteworthy in light of the so-called “transparency revolution” in other areas of American life. As one scholar has put it: “While data are available to help patients pick doctors, investors pick stocks, parents choose schools, passengers select airlines, and diners choose restaurants, even the most basic information on attorney quality remains stubbornly elusive.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1705" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1705" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">This is not to say that resources are absent—just that they are lacking. For instance, legal directories and referral services are available, but they do not typically provide information about disciplinary, criminal, and malpractice histories. Martindale-Hubbell is available, but it targets corporate clients, which is precisely the segment of the market where information deficits are smallest. Some new web-based for-profit lawyer rating services are entering the market, including Avvo, Yelp, and LawyerRatingz.com. Because some of these websites identify lawyers with clean records and adequate malpractice insurance, they perform a valuable service by creating additional incentives for appropriate conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1706" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1706" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> But these, too, are far from comprehensive:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">[T]hese websites tend to rely heavily on voluntarily submitted client reviews, and clients often lack the capacity to judge the quality of legal services received, dramatically reducing reliability. Worse, the reviews might not even come from actual clients. As LawyerRatingz candidly disclaims, “[I]t is not possible for us to verify which raters have knowledge of which lawyers, so always take the ratings with a grain of salt. Remember, we have no way of knowing who is doing the rating—customers, people in the lawyer industry, regular people, dogs, cats, etc.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1707" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1707" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Worryingly, a 2014 survey found that Yelp was the most popular of these services.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1708" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1708" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> Unlike Avvo, FindLaw, and several other alternatives, Yelp does not specialize in reviews of legal services. Furthermore, robust empirical analysis of restaurant reviews has found that Yelp is vulnerable to review fraud—particularly in the form of fake negative reviews.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1709" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1709" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> Anecdotal evidence makes clear that the legal industry is not immune from such tactics. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page768" class="pagebreak" title="768">768</span>In one reported instance, for example, a lawyer received a negative review from opposing counsel.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1710" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1710" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> Such services also raise the specter of <span style="font-style: italic;">quid pro quo</span> reviews. The New York Bar has ruled that a lawyer may give clients a $50 credit on their legal bills if they rate the lawyer on an internet website such as Avvo, so long as the credit is not contingent upon a particular rating, the client is not compelled, and the lawyer does not write the review or the rating.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1711" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1711" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">What is your view? Should the legal profession more actively support forms of public communication apart from advertising by individual attorneys? Following the lead of the medical profession, should it attempt to develop directories or clearinghouses of information that might provide centralized, objective, verifiable data about attorneys’ specialties, experience, education, disciplinary record, insurance status, malpractice history, and so forth?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1712" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1712" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextHeadFlush">While advertising is now generally permitted in the United States, per Rule 7.2, the same cannot be said of for-profit solicitation.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Experience with solicitation has been mixed.

This mixed record in promoting the public interest, on the one hand, and exploiting vulnerable parties, on the other, is explored in the readings below. The first excerpt, by Jerold Auerbach, criticizes restrictions on solicitation as a class-based and discriminatory mechanism to deprive injury victims of competent representation. After that, two excerpts present the two canonical Supreme Court cases concerning solicitation, decided the very same day in 1978.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">41–50 (1976).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The [1908 Canons of Professional Ethics] drew heavily upon George Sharswood’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Essay on Professional Ethics</span>, published in 1854. Sharswood’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Essay</span> was at best, antiquated; at worst, irrelevant. He had addressed it to a generation accustomed to moral exhortation and confident that its own definitions of character, honor, and duty were eternal verities. Warning even in the 1850s of “a horde of pettifogging, barratrous, money-making lawyers,” Sharswood had urged “high moral principle” as the bedrock of professional dignity. Passivity and patience were his cardinal virtues. Like young maidens awaiting suitors, aspiring lawyers must await clients. “Let business seek the young attorney,” Sharswood insisted. It might come too slowly for profit or fame (or never come at all), but if the lawyer cultivated “habits of neatness, accuracy, punctuality, and dispatch, candor toward his client, and strict honor toward his adversary, it may be safely prophesied that his business will grow as fast as it is good for him that it should grow.” Sharswood’s safe prophecy may have comforted a young nineteenth-century attorney in a homogeneous small town, apprenticed to an established practitioner, known in his community, and without many competitors. It could hardly reassure his twentieth-century counterpart, the new-immigrant neophyte in a large city where restricted firms monopolized the most lucrative business and thousands of attorneys scrambled for a share of the remainder. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[The bar’s ethical prohibitions] rewarded the lawyer whose law-firm partners and social contacts made advertising unnecessary at the same time that it attributed inferior character and unethical behavior to attorneys who could not afford to sit passively in their offices awaiting clients; it thus penalized both them and their potential clients, who might not know whether they had a valid legal claim or where, if they did, to obtain legal assistance. The canon prohibiting solicitation discriminated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page772" class="pagebreak" title="772">772</span>against those in personal injury practice, who bore the pejorative label “ambulance chasers.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[This canon] . . . consigned the lawyer to his office to await a client who wandered by with a case that assured fame and fortune, and attributed success (hardly unrelated in American society to monetary accumulation) to good character. The lower the fee a lawyer earned, and the less discreet he was in pursuit of it, the more likely it was that his “money getting” activities would be scrutinized and criticized. The Canons especially impeded those lawyers who worked in a highly competitive urban market with a transient clientele. Little wonder that they made more sense to an attorney in Sullivan &amp; Cromwell or in Fairfax County, Virginia than to a personal injury lawyer on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ambulance chasers became the scapegoats in a heterogeneous profession increasingly populated by foreign-born lawyers. As Boston attorney Reginald Heber Smith concluded, the contingent fee system might be the logical outcome of the existing maldistribution of legal services but it nonetheless constituted “the great blot on the history of the American bar”—primarily because the lure of money attracted “undesirable persons” to the profession. Years later the problem still would be perceived as personal rather than systemic, the responsibility of mercenary lawyers rather than the result of institutional inequity. In 1929, after a lengthy publicized investigation in New York into the evils of ambulance chasing, resulting in recommendations of disciplinary proceedings against seventy-four lawyers, the chief counsel pointedly observed that some attorneys who had testified “could not speak the King’s English correctly. . . . These men by character, by background, by environment, by education were unfitted to be lawyers.” . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“Ambulance chasing” was never precisely defined. As a term of art it ostracized plaintiffs’ lawyers who, representing outsiders to the economic system, solicited certain types of business. Once fee-hungry ambulance chasers were isolated, they could be excluded from professional respectability by a series of discriminatory ethical judgments. Their methods of solicitation were condemned, but nothing was said about company claim agents who visited hospitalized workers to urge a quick and inexpensive settlement. Their [contingent] fees were isolated for judicial scrutiny, but larger corporate retainers were ignored by professional associations. . . . Not only were [personal injury lawyers] criticized for professional malfeasance; their speech was mocked (many were recent immigrants) and their perseverance was denigrated as aggressiveness (many were Jewish). Commercialization, speculation, solicitation, and excessive litigation were decried, but there was no mention of the contribution of contingent fees to the enforcement of legitimate claims otherwise denied by the victim’s poverty.</p>

Appellant made a telephone call to Ms. McClintock’s parents, who informed him that their daughter was in the hospital. Appellant suggested that he might visit Carol in the hospital. Mrs. McClintock assented to the idea, but requested that appellant first stop by at her home.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During appellant’s visit with the McClintocks, they explained that their daughter had been driving the family automobile on a local road when she was hit by an uninsured motorist. Both Carol and her passenger, Wanda Lou Holbert, were injured and hospitalized. In response to the McClintocks’ expression of apprehension that they might be sued by Holbert, appellant explained that Ohio’s guest statute would preclude such a suit. When appellant suggested to the McClintocks that they hire a lawyer, Mrs. McClintock retorted that such a decision would be up to Carol, who was 18 years old and would be the beneficiary of a successful claim.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Appellant proceeded to the hospital, where he found Carol lying in traction in her room. After a brief conversation about her condition, appellant told Carol he would represent her and asked her to sign an agreement. Carol said she would have to discuss the matter with her parents. She did not sign the agreement, but asked appellant to have her parents come to see her. Appellant also attempted to see Wanda Lou Holbert, but learned that she had just been released from the hospital. He then departed for another visit with the McClintocks.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On his way appellant detoured to the scene of the accident, where he took a set of photographs. He also picked up a tape recorder, which he concealed under his raincoat before arriving at the McClintocks’ residence. Once there, he re-examined their automobile insurance policy, discussed with them the law applicable to passengers, and explained the consequences of the fact that the driver who struck Carol’s car was an uninsured motorist. Appellant discovered that the McClintocks’ insurance policy would provide benefits of up to $12,500 each for Carol <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page774" class="pagebreak" title="774">774</span>and Wanda Lou under an uninsured-motorist clause. Mrs. McClintock acknowledged that both Carol and Wanda Lou could sue for their injuries, but recounted to appellant that “Wanda Lou swore up and down she would not do it.” The McClintocks also told appellant that Carol had phoned to say that appellant could “go ahead” with her representation. Two days later appellant returned to Carol’s hospital room to have her sign a contract, which provided that he would receive one-third of her recovery.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the meantime, appellant obtained Wanda Lou’s name and address from the McClintocks after telling them he wanted to ask her some questions about the accident. He then visited Wanda Lou at her home, without having been invited. He again concealed his tape recorder and recorded most of the conversation with Wanda Lou. After a brief, unproductive inquiry about the facts of the accident, appellant told Wanda Lou that he was representing Carol and that he had a “little tip” for Wanda Lou: the McClintocks’ insurance policy contained an uninsured-motorist clause which might provide her with a recovery of up to $12,500. The young woman, who was 18 years of age and not a high school graduate at the time, replied to appellant’s query about whether she was going to file a claim by stating that she really did not understand what was going on. Appellant offered to represent her, also, for a contingent fee of one-third of any recovery, and Wanda Lou stated “O.K.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Wanda Lou’s mother attempted to repudiate her daughter’s oral assent the following day, when appellant called on the telephone to speak to Wanda Lou. Mrs. Holbert informed appellant that she and her daughter did not want to sue anyone or to have appellant represent them, and that if they decided to sue they would consult their own lawyer. Appellant insisted that Wanda Lou had entered into a binding agreement. A month later Wanda Lou confirmed in writing that she wanted neither to sue nor to be represented by appellant. She requested that appellant notify the insurance company that he was not her lawyer, as the company would not release a check to her until he did so. Carol also eventually discharged appellant. Although another lawyer represented her in concluding a settlement with the insurance company, she paid appellant one-third of her recovery in settlement of his lawsuit against her for breach of contract . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After a hearing, the Board found that appellant had violated Disciplinary Rules (DR) 2–103(A)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;DR 2–103(A)&quot; \s &quot;2–103(A)&quot; \c 16 " /> and 2–104(A)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;DR 2–104(A)&quot; \s &quot;2–104(A)&quot; \c 16 " /> of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility [forbidding solicitation]. The Board rejected appellant’s defense that his conduct was protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court of Ohio adopted the findings of the Board, reiterated that appellant’s conduct was not constitutionally protected, and increased the sanction of a public reprimand recommended by the Board to indefinite suspension. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page775" class="pagebreak" title="775">775</span>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">II</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The solicitation of business by a lawyer through direct, in-person communication with the prospective client has long been viewed as inconsistent with the profession’s ideal of the attorney-client relationship and as posing a significant potential for harm to the prospective client. It has been proscribed by the organized Bar for many years. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In-person solicitation by a lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction in which speech is an essential but subordinate component. While this does not remove the speech from the protection of the First Amendment, as was held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Virginia Pharmacy</span>, it lowers the level of appropriate judicial scrutiny.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . Unlike a public advertisement, which simply provides information and leaves the recipient free to act upon it or not, in-person solicitation may exert pressure and often demands an immediate response, without providing an opportunity for comparison or reflection. The aim and effect of in-person solicitation may be to provide a one-sided presentation and to encourage speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking: there is no opportunity for intervention or counter-education by agencies of the Bar, supervisory authorities, or persons close to the solicited individual. The admonition that “the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones” is of little value when the circumstances provide no opportunity for any remedy at all. In-person solicitation is as likely as not to discourage persons needing counsel from engaging in a critical comparison of the “availability, nature, and prices” of legal services, . . . it actually may disserve the individual and societal interest, identified in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, in facilitating “informed and reliable decisionmaking.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It also is argued that in-person solicitation may provide the solicited individual with information about his or her legal rights and remedies. In this case, appellant gave Wanda Lou a “tip” about the prospect of recovery based on the uninsured-motorist clause in the McClintocks’ insurance policy, and he explained that clause and Ohio’s guest statute to Carol McClintock’s parents. But neither of the Disciplinary Rules here at issue prohibited appellant from communicating information to these young women about their legal rights and the prospects of obtaining a monetary recovery, or from recommending that they obtain counsel. DR 2–104(A) merely prohibited him from using the information as bait with which to obtain an agreement to represent them for a fee. The Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from giving unsolicited legal advice; it proscribes the acceptance of employment resulting from such advice. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A lawyer’s procurement of remunerative employment is a subject only marginally affected with First Amendment concerns. It falls within the State’s proper sphere of economic and professional regulation. . . . <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page776" class="pagebreak" title="776">776</span>While entitled to some constitutional protection, appellant’s conduct is subject to regulation in furtherance of important state interests.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1726" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1726" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">B</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The substantive evils of solicitation have been stated over the years in sweeping terms: stirring up litigation, assertion of fraudulent claims, debasing the legal profession, and potential harm to the solicited client in the form of overreaching, overcharging, underrepresentation, and misrepresentation. The American Bar Association, as <span style="font-style: italic;">amicus curiae</span>, defends the rule against solicitation primarily on three broad grounds: It is said that the prohibitions embodied in DR 2–103(A) and 2–104(A) serve to reduce the likelihood of overreaching and the exertion of undue influence on lay persons, to protect the privacy of individuals, and to avoid situations where the lawyer’s exercise of judgment on behalf of the client will be clouded by his own pecuniary self-interest.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1727" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1727" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We need not discuss or evaluate each of these interests in detail as appellant has conceded that the State has a legitimate and indeed “compelling” interest in preventing those aspects of solicitation that involve fraud, undue influence, intimidation, overreaching, and other forms of “vexatious conduct.” We agree that protection of the public from these aspects of solicitation is a legitimate and important state interest.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Appellant’s concession that strong state interests justify regulation to prevent the evils he enumerates would end this case but for his insistence that none of these evils was found to be present in his acts of solicitation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Appellant’s argument misconceives the nature of the State’s interest. The Rules prohibiting solicitation are prophylactic measures whose objective is the prevention of harm before it occurs. The Rules were applied in this case to discipline a lawyer for soliciting employment for pecuniary gain under circumstances likely to result in the adverse consequences the State seeks to avert. In such a situation, which is inherently conducive to overreaching and other forms of misconduct, the State has a strong interest in adopting and enforcing rules of conduct <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page777" class="pagebreak" title="777">777</span>designed to protect the public from harmful solicitation by lawyers whom it has licensed.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The State’s perception of the potential for harm in circumstances such as those presented in this case is well founded. The detrimental aspects of face-to-face selling even of ordinary consumer products have been recognized and addressed by the Federal Trade Commission, and it hardly need be said that the potential for overreaching is significantly greater when a lawyer, a professional trained in the art of persuasion, personally solicits an unsophisticated, injured, or distressed lay person. Such an individual may place his trust in a lawyer, regardless of the latter’s qualifications or the individual’s actual need for legal representation, simply in response to persuasion under circumstances conducive to uninformed acquiescence. Although it is argued that personal solicitation is valuable because it may apprise a victim of misfortune of his legal rights, the very plight of that person not only makes him more vulnerable to influence but also may make advice all the more intrusive. Thus, under these adverse conditions the overtures of an uninvited lawyer may distress the solicited individual simply because of their obtrusiveness and the invasion of the individual’s privacy, even when no other harm materializes. Under such circumstances, it is not unreasonable for the State to presume that in-person solicitation by lawyers more often than not will be injurious to the person solicited.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The efficacy of the State’s effort to prevent such harm to prospective clients would be substantially diminished if, having proved a solicitation in circumstances like those of this case, the State were required in addition to prove actual injury. Unlike the advertising in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>, in-person solicitation is not visible or otherwise open to public scrutiny. Often there is no witness other than the lawyer and the lay person whom he has solicited, rendering it difficult or impossible to obtain reliable proof of what actually took place. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under our view of the State’s interest in averting harm by prohibiting solicitation in circumstances where it is likely to occur, the absence of explicit proof or findings of harm or injury is immaterial. The facts in this case present a striking example of the potential for overreaching that is inherent in a lawyer’s in-person solicitation of professional employment. They also demonstrate the need for prophylactic regulation in furtherance of the State’s interest in protecting the lay public. We hold that the application of DR 2–103(A)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;DR 2–103(A)&quot; \s &quot;DR 2–103(A)&quot; \c 16 " /> and 2–104(A)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;2–104(A)&quot; " /> to appellant does not offend the Constitution. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Mr. Justice Marshall</span>, concurring in part and concurring in the judgments. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What is objectionable about Ohralik’s behavior here is not so much that he solicited business for himself, but rather the circumstances in which he performed that solicitation and the means by which he accomplished it. Appropriately, the Court’s actual holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page778" class="pagebreak" title="778">778</span>a limited one: that the solicitation of business, under circumstances—such as those found in this record—presenting substantial dangers of harm to society or the client independent of the solicitation itself, may constitutionally be prohibited by the State. In this much of the Court’s opinion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, I join fully. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Notwithstanding the injurious aspects of Ohralik’s conduct, even his case illustrates the potentially useful, information-providing aspects of attorney solicitation: Motivated by the desire for pecuniary gain, but informed with the special training and knowledge of an attorney, Ohralik advised both his clients (apparently correctly) that, although they had been injured by an uninsured motorist, they could nonetheless recover on the McClintocks’ insurance policy. The provision of such information about legal rights and remedies is an important function, even where the rights and remedies are of a private and commercial nature involving no constitutional or political overtones.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In view of the similar functions performed by advertising and solicitation by attorneys, I find somewhat disturbing the Court’s suggestion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> that in-person solicitation of business, though entitled to some degree of constitutional protection as “commercial speech,” is entitled to less protection under the First Amendment than is “the kind of advertising approved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>.” The First Amendment informational interests served by solicitation, whether or not it occurs in a purely commercial context, are substantial, and they are entitled to as much protection as the interests we found to be protected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">B</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Not only do prohibitions on solicitation interfere with the free flow of information protected by the First Amendment, but by origin and in practice they operate in a discriminatory manner. As we have noted, these constraints developed as rules of “etiquette” and came to rest on the notion that a lawyer’s reputation in his community would spread by word of mouth and bring business to the worthy lawyer. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates v. State Bar of Arizona</span>. The social model on which this conception depends is that of the small, cohesive, and homogeneous community; the anachronistic nature of this model has long been recognized. If ever this conception were more generally true, it is now valid only with respect to those persons who move in the relatively elite social and educational circles in which knowledge about legal problems, legal remedies, and lawyers is widely shared.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The impact of the nonsolicitation rules, moreover, is discriminatory with respect to the suppliers as well as the consumers of legal services. Just as the persons who suffer most from lack of knowledge about lawyers’ availability belong to the less privileged classes of society . . . so the disciplinary rules against solicitation fall most heavily on those attorneys engaged in a single-practitioner or small-partnership form of practice—attorneys who typically earn less than their fellow practitioners in larger, corporate-oriented firms. Indeed, some scholars <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page779" class="pagebreak" title="779">779</span>have suggested that the rules against solicitation were developed by the professional bar to keep recently immigrated lawyers, who gravitated toward the smaller, personal injury practice, from effective entry into the profession. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> J. Auerbach, <span style="font-style: italic;">Unequal Justice</span> 42–62, 126–129 (1976). In light of this history, I am less inclined than the majority appears to be, <span style="font-style: italic;">ante</span>, to weigh favorably in the balance of the State’s interests here the longevity of the ban on attorney solicitation.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">C</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">By discussing the origin and impact of the nonsolicitation rules, I do not mean to belittle those obviously substantial interests that the State has in regulating attorneys to protect the public from fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, overreaching, undue influence, and invasions of privacy. But where honest, unpressured “commercial” solicitation is involved—a situation not presented in either of these cases—I believe it is open to doubt whether the State’s interests are sufficiently compelling to warrant the restriction on the free flow of information which results from a sweeping nonsolicitation rule and against which the First Amendment ordinarily protects. While the State’s interest in regulating in-person solicitation may, for reasons explained <span style="font-style: italic;">ante</span>, . . . be somewhat greater than its interest in regulating printed advertisements, these concededly legitimate interests might well be served by more specific and less restrictive rules than a total ban on pecuniary solicitation. For example, the Justice Department has suggested that the disciplinary rules be reworded “so as to <span style="font-style: italic;">permit</span> all solicitation and advertising except the kinds that are false, misleading, undignified or champertous.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To the extent that in-person solicitation of business may constitutionally be subjected to more substantial state regulation as to time, place, and manner than printed advertising of legal services, it is not because such solicitation has “traditionally” been banned, nor because one form of commercial speech is of less value than another under the First Amendment. Rather, any additional restrictions can be justified only to the degree that dangers which the State has a right to prevent are actually presented by conduct attendant to such speech, thus increasing the relative “strength of the State’s countervailing interest in prohibition.” As the majority notes, and I wholeheartedly agree, these dangers are amply present in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> case.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Accordingly, while I concur in the judgments of the Court in both of these cases [<span style="font-style: italic;">Primus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>], I join in the Court’s opinions only to the extent and with the exceptions noted above.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted, the very same day that the Court decided <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, the Court decided <span style="font-style: italic;">In re Primus. In re Primus</span> involved a South Carolina civil rights attorney named Edna Smith Primus who provided pro bono services for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and paid <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page780" class="pagebreak" title="780">780</span>assistance to the South Carolina Council on Human Relations. During the early 1970s, Gary Allen, a representative of an organization serving low-income communities, asked Primus to provide information to female welfare recipients who were being sterilized or threatened with sterilization as a condition of continued receipt of Medicaid benefits in Aiken, South Carolina. At a meeting with some of these women in Allen’s office, Primus provided advice about their legal rights and suggested the possibility of bringing a lawsuit.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A month later, Primus learned from the ACLU that it was willing to represent women who had been sterilized. She also learned from Allen that one woman who had attended the previous meeting, Mary Williams, was interested in taking legal action. Mary Williams ultimately got cold feet, but before she did, she received the following letter from Primus, which ultimately made its way into the hands of South Carolina disciplinary authorities:</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Decided in 1963 in the midst of the civil rights movement, <span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> involved an NAACP challenge to a Virginia statute which had been construed to prohibit NAACP members and staff attorneys from soliciting desegregation plaintiffs and referring them to the NAACP for free legal assistance. Sustaining the NAACP’s challenge, the Court held that the First Amendment protects advice from NAACP attorneys to prospective litigants, notwithstanding the Commonwealth of Virginia’s power to regulate the legal profession.

      <p class="TextParagraph">[W]e decide today in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.</span>, that the States may vindicate legitimate regulatory interests through proscription, in certain circumstances, of in-person solicitation by lawyers who seek to communicate purely commercial offers of legal assistance to lay persons.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Unlike the situation in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, however, appellant’s act of solicitation took the form of a letter to a woman with whom appellant had discussed the possibility of seeking redress for an allegedly unconstitutional sterilization. This was not in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain. Appellant was communicating an offer of free assistance by attorneys associated with the ACLU, not an offer predicated on entitlement to a share of any monetary recovery. And her actions were undertaken to express personal political beliefs and to advance the civil-liberties objectives of the ACLU, rather than to derive financial gain. The question presented in this case is whether, in light of the values protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, these differences materially affect the scope of state regulation of the conduct of lawyers. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Supreme Court of South Carolina found appellant to have engaged in unethical conduct because she “ ‘solicit[ed] a client for a non-profit organization, which, as its primary purpose, renders legal services, where respondent’s associate is a staff counsel for the non-profit organization.<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span> It rejected appellant’s First Amendment defenses by distinguishing <span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> from the case before it. Whereas the NAACP in that case was primarily a “ ‘political<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span> organization that used “ ‘litigation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page782" class="pagebreak" title="782">782</span>as an adjunct to the overriding political aims of the organization,<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span> the ACLU “ ‘has as one of its primary purposes the rendition of legal services.’ ” The court also intimated that the ACLU’s policy of requesting an award of counsel fees indicated that the organization might “ ‘benefit financially in the event of successful prosecution of the suit for money damages.<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We find . . . unpersuasive any suggestion that the level of constitutional scrutiny in this case should be lowered because of a possible benefit to the ACLU. The discipline administered to appellant was premised solely on the possibility of financial benefit to the organization, rather than any possibility of pecuniary gain to herself, her associates, or the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Walker v. Pierce</span> litigation. It is conceded that appellant received no compensation for any of the activities in question. It is also undisputed that neither the ACLU nor any lawyer associated with it would have shared in any monetary recovery by the plaintiffs in <span style="font-style: italic;">Walker v. Pierce</span>. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Contrary to appellee’s suggestion, the ACLU’s policy of requesting an award of counsel fees does not take this case outside the protection of <span style="font-style: italic;">Button.</span> Although the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> did not consider whether the NAACP seeks counsel fees, such requests are often made by that organization. In any event in a case of this kind there are differences between counsel fees awarded by a court and traditional fee-paying arrangements which militate against a presumption that ACLU sponsorship of litigation is motivated by considerations of pecuniary gain rather than by its widely recognized goal of vindicating civil liberties. Counsel fees are awarded in the discretion of the court; awards are not drawn from the plaintiff’s recovery, and are usually premised on a successful outcome; and the amounts awarded often may not correspond to fees generally obtainable in private litigation. Moreover, under prevailing law during the events in question, an award of counsel fees in federal litigation was available only in limited circumstances. And even if there had been an award during the period in question, it would have gone to the central fund of the ACLU.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1728" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1728" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> Although such benefit to the organization may increase with the maintenance of successful litigation, the same situation obtains with voluntary contributions and foundation support, which also may rise with ACLU victories in important areas of the law. That possibility, standing alone, offers no basis for equating the work of lawyers associated with the ACLU or the NAACP with that of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page783" class="pagebreak" title="783">783</span>group that exists for the primary purpose of financial gain through the recovery of counsel fees.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Appellant’s letter of August 30, 1973, to Mrs. Williams thus comes within the generous zone of First Amendment protection reserved for associational freedoms. The ACLU engages in litigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and association, as well as a means of communicating useful information to the public. <span style="font-style: italic;">See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona</span>. As <span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span> indicates, and as appellant offered to prove at the disciplinary hearing, the efficacy of litigation as a means of advancing the cause of civil liberties often depends on the ability to make legal assistance available to suitable litigants. “ ‘Free trade in ideas’ means free trade in the opportunity to persuade to action, not merely to describe facts.” The First and Fourteenth Amendments require a measure of protection for “advocating lawful means of vindicating legal rights,” <a id="dabmci_61fc4e4626c940128c21521357cdaae0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span>, 371 U.S., at 437, including “advis[ing] another that his legal rights have been infringed and refer[ring] him to a particular attorney or group of attorneys . . . for assistance,” <a id="dabmci_e2bbfc9726d74a0da5dbd5eb956f9d22" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">id</span>., at 434.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">V</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">South Carolina’s action in punishing appellant for soliciting a prospective litigant by mail, on behalf of the ACLU, must withstand the “exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core First Amendment rights . . . ” <span style="font-style: italic;">Buckley v. Valeo</span>. South Carolina must demonstrate “a subordinating interest which is compelling,” <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> and that the means employed in furtherance of that interest are “closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.” <span style="font-style: italic;">Buckley</span>. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Appellee contends that the disciplinary action taken in this case is part of a regulatory program aimed at the prevention of undue influence, overreaching, misrepresentation, invasion of privacy, conflict of interest, lay interference, and other evils that are thought to inhere generally in solicitation by lawyers of prospective clients, and to be present on the record before us. Brief for Appellee 37–49. We do not dispute the importance of these interests.

Because of the danger of censorship through selective enforcement of broad prohibitions, and “[b]ecause First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in [this] area only with narrow specificity.” <a id="dabmci_f2208eadbe09441d9826e8bb7be119d2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Button</span>, 371 U.S., at 433. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Where political expression or association is at issue, this Court has not tolerated the degree of imprecision that often characterizes government regulation of the conduct of commercial affairs. The approach we adopt today in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, that the State may proscribe in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain under circumstances likely to result in adverse consequences, cannot be applied to appellant’s activity on behalf of the ACLU. Although a showing of potential danger may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page784" class="pagebreak" title="784">784</span>suffice in the former context, appellant may not be disciplined unless her activity in fact involved the type of misconduct at which South Carolina’s broad prohibition is said to be directed.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The record does not support appellee’s contention that undue influence, overreaching, misrepresentation, or invasion of privacy actually occurred in this case. Appellant’s letter of August 30, 1973, followed up the earlier meeting—one concededly protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments—by notifying Williams that the ACLU would be interested in supporting possible litigation. The letter imparted additional information material to making an informed decision about whether to authorize litigation, and permitted Williams an opportunity, which she exercised, for arriving at a deliberate decision. The letter was not facially misleading, indeed, it offered “to explain what is involved so you can understand what is going on.” The transmittal of this letter—as contrasted with in-person solicitation—involved no appreciable invasion of privacy; nor did it afford any significant opportunity for overreaching or coercion. Moreover, the fact that there was a written communication lessens substantially the difficulty of policing solicitation practices that do offend valid rules of professional conduct. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The State is free to fashion reasonable restrictions with respect to the time, place, and manner of solicitation by members of its Bar. [ ] The State’s special interest in regulating members whose profession it licenses, and who serve as officers of its courts, amply justifies the application of narrowly drawn rules to proscribe solicitation that in fact is misleading, overbearing, or involves other features of deception or improper influence. As we decide today in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, a State also may forbid in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain under circumstances likely to result in these evils. And a State may insist that lawyers not solicit on behalf of lay organizations that exert control over the actual conduct of any ensuing litigation. . . . Accordingly, nothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose carefully tailored regulation that does not abridge unnecessarily the associational freedom of nonprofit organizations or their members, having characteristics like those of the NAACP or the ACLU.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We conclude that South Carolina’s application of its [disciplinary rules] to appellant’s solicitation by letter on behalf of the ACLU violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina is</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Reversed.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In this case and the companion case of <a id="dabmci_f548a1f697ec4e77835d82207be8b72b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn</span>.<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association&quot; \s &quot;Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.&quot; \c 3 " />, 436 U.S. 447, the Court tells its own tale of two lawyers: One tale ends happily for the lawyer and one does not. If we were given the latitude of novelists in deciding between happy and unhappy endings for the heroes and villains of our tales, I might well join in the Court’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page785" class="pagebreak" title="785">785</span>disposition of both cases. But under our federal system it is for the States to decide which lawyers shall be admitted to the Bar and remain there; this Court may interfere only if the State’s decision is rendered impermissible by the United States Constitution. We can, of course, develop a jurisprudence of epithets and slogans in this area, in which “ambulance chasers” suffer one fate and “civil liberties lawyers” another. But I remain unpersuaded by the Court’s opinions in these two cases that there is a principled basis for concluding that the First and Fourteenth Amendments forbid South Carolina from disciplining Primus here, but permit Ohio to discipline Ohralik in the companion case. I believe that both South Carolina and Ohio acted within the limits prescribed by those Amendments, and I would therefore affirm the judgment in each case. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In distinguishing between Primus’ protected solicitation and Ohralik’s unprotected solicitation, the Court lamely declares: “We have not discarded the ‘common-sense’ distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.” Yet to the extent that this “common-sense” distinction focuses on the content of the speech, it is at least suspect under many of this Court’s First Amendment cases, and to the extent it focuses upon the motive of the speaker, it is subject to manipulation by clever practitioners. If Albert Ohralik, like Edna Primus, viewed litigation “ ‘not [as] a technique of resolving private differences,’ ” but as “ ‘a form of political expression’ and ‘political association,’ ” for all that appears he would be restored to his right to practice. And we may be sure that the next lawyer in Ohralik’s shoes who is disciplined for similar conduct will come here cloaked in the prescribed mantle of “political association” to assure that insurance companies do not take unfair advantage of policyholders.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This absence of any principled distinction between the two cases is made all the more unfortunate by the radical difference in scrutiny brought to bear upon state regulation in each area. Where solicitation proposes merely a commercial transaction, the Court recognizes “the need for prophylactic regulation in furtherance of the State’s interest in protecting the lay public.” On the other hand, in some circumstances (at least in those identical to the instant case)<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1729" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1729" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> “[w]here political expression <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page786" class="pagebreak" title="786">786</span>or association is at issue,” a member of the Bar “may not be disciplined unless her activity in fact involve[s] the type of misconduct at which South Carolina’s broad prohibition is said to be directed.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As the Court understands the Disciplinary Rule enforced by South Carolina, “a lawyer employed by the ACLU or a similar organization may never give unsolicited advice to a lay person that he or she retain the organization’s free services.” That prohibition seems to me entirely reasonable. A State may rightly fear that members of its Bar have powers of persuasion not possessed by laymen, and it may also fear that such persuasion may be as potent in writing as it is in person. Such persuasion may draw an unsophisticated layman into litigation contrary to his own best interests, and it may force other citizens of South Carolina to defend against baseless litigation which would not otherwise have been brought. I cannot agree that a State must prove such harmful consequences in each case simply because an organization such as the ACLU or the NAACP is involved.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I cannot share the Court’s confidence that the danger of such consequences is minimized simply because a lawyer proceeds from political conviction rather than for pecuniary gain. A State may reasonably fear that a lawyer’s desire to resolve “substantial civil liberties questions,” may occasionally take precedence over his duty to advance the interests of his client. It is even more reasonable to fear that a lawyer in such circumstances will be inclined to pursue both culpable and blameless defendants to the last ditch in order to achieve his ideological goals. Although individual litigants, including the ACLU, may be free to use the courts for such purposes, South Carolina is likewise free to restrict the activities of the members of its Bar who attempt to persuade them to do so.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I can only conclude that the discipline imposed upon Primus does not violate the Constitution, and I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court decided another solicitation case, <a id="dabmci_1536088def4342cd8a5c5ef864bf1050" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Florida Bar v. Went For It</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Inc</span>., 515 U.S. 618 (1995). <span style="font-style: italic;">Went For It</span> involved a Florida rule adopted in 1990 that prohibited lawyers from soliciting accident victims or their families by mail for thirty days after an accident. G. Stewart McHenry was a member of the Florida Bar who ran a lawyer referral service, Went For It, Inc. (WFI), which regularly solicited personal injury and wrongful death clients through direct mail advertising within thirty days of an accident. Soon after the new restriction went into effect, McHenry filed an action in federal court challenging it. His challenge ultimately made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page787" class="pagebreak" title="787">787</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Once at the Supreme Court, there was no question that the relevant test for evaluating restrictions on commercial speech was “intermediate” scrutiny under the framework set forth three years after <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates</span> in <a id="dabmci_8e8c69e20f544c92ab3be2c9e55af418" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm’n of New York</span>, 447 U.S. 557 (1980). Under <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span>, the government may freely regulate misleading commercial speech. The government may also regulate commercial speech that is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> misleading if: (1) the government asserts a substantial interest in support of its regulation; (2) the government demonstrates that the restriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances that interest; and (3) the regulation is “narrowly drawn.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Applying <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span>, the Florida Bar asserted that it had a substantial interest in preserving reasonable standards of personal privacy and maintaining the public’s opinion of the legal profession and justice system:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Because direct-mail solicitations in the wake of accidents are perceived by the public as intrusive, the Bar argues, the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of Floridians has suffered commensurably. The regulation, then, is an effort to protect the flagging reputations of Florida lawyers by preventing them from engaging in conduct that, the Bar maintains, “is universally regarded as deplorable and beneath common decency because of its intrusion upon the special vulnerability and private grief of victims or their families.”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_f351849aa7e54b26b829ae15bc18cbbb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />515 U.S. at 625.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In supporting that claim, the Bar cited the results of a public opinion survey it had conducted over the course of two years, as well as anecdotal accounts of victims who had been offended by lawyers’ letters. The survey found, among other things, that about a quarter of consumers reported lower regard for the profession as a result of solicitation, and 54 percent of the general public said that “contacting persons concerning accidents or similar events is a violation of privacy.” <a id="dabmci_adf148378ef54097847acd53030e197c" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 626.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In opposition, WFI advanced two pertinent arguments. First, it asserted that the instant case was nearly identical to <a id="dabmci_288c12c2d4a0409db07611144819c8a6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Shapero v.

Kentucky Bar Ass’n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Ass’n</span>, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). In that case, decided seven years before, the Court had struck down Kentucky’s absolute ban (without any thirty-day limit) on the mailing or delivery of written advertisements “precipitated by a specific event or occurrence involving or relating to the addressee or addressees as distinct from the general public.” Second, WFI argued that the Florida Bar failed to satisfy the requirements of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span> test.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In a decision written by Justice O’Connor, the Court ultimately sided with the Florida Bar. The Court held that the Bar’s proffered interests of protecting potential clients’ privacy and improving Florida lawyers’ flagging reputations were narrowly drawn and substantial. The Court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page788" class="pagebreak" title="788">788</span>distinguished <span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span> by pointing out that the ban in <a id="dabmci_84507e65a3dd45b79541ff0721dbf9ca" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span> was not time-limited and that the state in <a id="dabmci_026e13f5e1a44835bcc72c4e41400a61" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span> had assembled no evidence to demonstrate any actual harm caused by direct-mail solicitation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Elsewhere in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Went For It</span> opinion, the Court described the “ample alternative channels” available to prospective clients to receive information about available legal representation and noted:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[R]espondents have not pointed to—and we have not independently found—a single example of an individual case in which immediate solicitation helped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days brought about, the harms that concern the dissent. In fact, the record contains considerable empirical survey information suggesting that Floridians have little difficulty finding a lawyer when they need one. Finding no basis to question the commonsense conclusion that the many alternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Florida’s regulation.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_7e2b6aed820149faa2f46017b18ee5ce" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />515 U.S. at 634.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Went For It</span> was a five-to-four opinion. Joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, Justice Kennedy issued a forceful dissent:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Attorneys who communicate their willingness to assist potential clients are engaged in speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. That principle has been understood since <span style="font-style: italic;">Bates v. State Bar of Ariz</span>. (1977). The Court today undercuts this guarantee in an important class of cases and unsettles leading First Amendment precedents, at the expense of those victims most in need of legal assistance. With all respect for the Court, in my view its solicitude for the privacy of victims and its concern for our profession are misplaced and self-defeating, even upon the Court’s own premises.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">I take it to be uncontroverted that when an accident results in death or injury, it is often urgent at once to investigate the occurrence, identify witnesses, and preserve evidence. Vital interests in speech and expression are, therefore, at stake when by law an attorney cannot direct a letter to the victim or the family explaining this simple fact and offering competent legal assistance. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">As the Court notes, the first of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span> factors to be considered is whether the interest the State pursues in enacting the speech restriction is a substantial one. The State says two different interests meet this standard. The first is the interest “in protecting the personal privacy and tranquility” of the victim and his or her family. As the Court notes, that interest has recognition in our decisions as a general matter; but it does not follow that the privacy interest in the cases the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page789" class="pagebreak" title="789">789</span>majority cites is applicable here. The problem the Court confronts, and cannot overcome, is our recent decision in <a id="dabmci_ea0952f625b945af816062fdf02aecf6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Shapero v.

In [<a id="dabmci_ad31ff74bea64783b6806f32ae75fc17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span>], we made an explicit distinction between direct, in-person solicitations and direct-mail solicitations. <span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span>, like this case, involved a direct-mail solicitation, and there the State recited its fears of “overreaching and undue influence.” We found, however, no such dangers presented by direct-mail advertising. We reasoned that “[a] letter, like a printed advertisement (but unlike a lawyer), can readily be put in a drawer to be considered later, ignored, or discarded.” We pointed out that “[t]he relevant inquiry is not whether there exist potential clients whose ‘condition’ makes them susceptible to undue influence, but whether the mode of communication poses a serious danger that lawyers will exploit any such susceptibility.” In assessing the substantiality of the evils to be prevented, we concluded that “the mode of communication makes all the difference.” The direct mail in <a id="dabmci_97fbaf163eb24ae7a6d05d07eae9bd17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Shapero</span> did not present the justification for regulation of speech presented in <a id="dabmci_08352a1859074af481ef0c06fa7636b5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Ohralik v.

Ohio State Bar Assn.</span>, 436 U.S. 447 (1978) (a lawyer’s direct, in-person solicitation of personal injury business may be prohibited by the State). . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">In the face of these difficulties of logic and precedent, the State and the opinion of the Court turn to a second interest: protecting the reputation and dignity of the legal profession. The argument is, it seems fair to say, that all are demeaned by the crass behavior of a few. . . . While disrespect will arise from an unethical or improper practice, the majority begs a most critical question by assuming that direct-mail solicitations constitute such a practice. The fact is, however, that direct solicitation may serve vital purposes and promote the administration of justice. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Even were the interests asserted substantial, the regulation here fails the second part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span> test, which requires that the dangers the State seeks to eliminate be real and that a speech restriction or ban advance that asserted state interest in a direct and material way. The burden of demonstrating the reality of the asserted harm rests on the State. Slight evidence in this regard does not mean there is sufficient evidence to support the claims. Here, what the State has offered falls well short of demonstrating that the harms it is trying to redress are real, let alone that the regulation directly and materially advances the State’s interests. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">. . . Were it appropriate to reach the third part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Central Hudson</span> test, it would be clear that the relationship between the Bar’s interests and the means chosen to serve them <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page790" class="pagebreak" title="790">790</span>is not a reasonable fit. The Bar’s rule creates a flat ban that prohibits far more speech than necessary to serve the purported state interest. Even assuming that interest were legitimate, there is a wild disproportion between the harm supposed and the speech ban enforced. . . .</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Above, the Court distinguishes <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Primus</span> in part based on the lawyers’ different pecuniary motivations. If Primus had been a self-supporting civil rights practitioner entitled to statutorily-prescribed attorneys’ fees, should she have been subject to disciplinary action?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the harms that <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> associated with solicitation, such as overreaching, undue influence, conflicts of interest, and invasion of privacy. To what extent can these harms occur irrespective of who initiates contact? What evidence supports the Court’s assumption that these harms are particularly likely to accompany fee-generating cases? Suppose that Ohralik’s only in-person contact had been with Carol McClintock’s parents, following his telephone call and their invitation to stop by their home.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Note the frequency of terms such as “may” and “likely” in the majority decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>. Before it limits speech, should the state be required to establish a firmer causal relationship between prohibited expression and the harms that assertedly follow from it?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 7.3(b) adopts a presumption against in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain, subject to exceptions for solicitation targeting close personal contacts or sophisticated consumers. In contrast, subsection (c) presumes in-person solicitation for non-pecuniary motives is valid so long as it does not involve overreaching. An alternative proposed by the Federal Trade Commission would essentially make all in-person solicitation, for pecuniary gain or not, subject to subsection (c)’s ban against overreaching. Specifically, the proposal would permit in-person solicitation unless it:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />involves harassment, coercion, or undue influence;</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Would such a prohibition, coupled with strict enforcement of existing rules on fraud and unreasonable fees, be preferable to Rule 7.3?</p>

Fane, 507 U.S. 761 (1993)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Edenfield v. Fane</span>, 507 U.S. 761 (1993),<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>the Court invalidated Florida’s ban on personal solicitation by certified public accountants (CPAs). The case involved a declaratory action by Scott Fane, a CPA who previously had built a practice in New Jersey by making unsolicited telephone calls to business executives and arranging meetings to explain his services and expertise. New Jersey, along with some twenty other states, permitted such solicitation. In the majority’s view, personal solicitation by CPAs differed from personal solicitation by lawyers. According to the Court, cases like <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span> involve unsophisticated clients at moments of “high stress and vulnerability.” By contrast, CPAs’ solicitation methods are generally conducive to “rational and considered decisionmaking” by experienced executives. Moreover, “the importance of repeat business and referrals gives the CPA a strong incentive to act in a responsible and decorous manner.” Finally, the dangers of overreaching by lawyers are greater than in the case of accountants, since lawyers are trained in the art of advocacy.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy also emphasized the positive aspects of solicitation:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">A seller has a strong financial incentive to educate the market and stimulate demand for his product or service, so solicitation produces more personal interchange between buyer and seller than would occur if only buyers were permitted to initiate contact. Personal interchange enables a potential buyer to meet and evaluate the person offering the product or service and allows both parties to discuss and negotiate the desired form for the transaction or professional relation. Solicitation also enables the seller to direct his proposals toward those consumers who he has a reason to believe would be most interested in what he has to sell. For the buyer, it provides an opportunity to explore in detail the way in which a particular product or service compares to its alternatives in the market.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_81d8a3aa1dd24e919c4e22acbb62dabc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />507 U.S. at 766.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Do similar considerations militate in favor of relaxing rules on solicitation in at least some legal contexts, where clients are not approached at times of special stress and vulnerability? Does lawyers’ advocacy training put them in an entirely different category than other sellers of professional services? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While lawyers are banned from soliciting clients, per Rule 7.3, insurance adjusters, who seek to settle personal injury claims on behalf of insurance companies (and their insureds), are usually not barred from approaching <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page792" class="pagebreak" title="792">792</span>injury victims to obtain a quick release. Unencumbered, they at least sometimes flock to the scene of accidents. Deborah Rhode has written that “recent mass disasters have witnessed industrious industry representatives waylaying family members en route from the funeral.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1731" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1731" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> Likewise, in his classic work on insurance claims adjusting following auto accidents, H. Laurence Ross noted that all potential claimants “were approached by the adjuster as quickly as possible.” Among the reasons for this procedure is that delay increases the likelihood the claimant will have retained attorneys, and represented claims are more expensive to settle.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1732" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1732" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Adding his voice to the chorus, one state supreme court justice noted many years ago:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Claim agents . . . try by fair means to obtain the lowest possible settlement for injured plaintiffs. . . . It is a veritable scramble between the claim agent and the “chaser” to see which one can reach an injured claimant first. The net result of timely arrival of the solicitor is that the claimant will eventually receive an amount that a court and jury deem adequate and just. . . . [The] solicitation of personal injury cases is the natural reflex or defensive response to the unfair methods of claim adjusters, just as naturally as the human organism elaborates its own antibodies to combat disease.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1733" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1733" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Accident victims who are represented by counsel appear to receive higher awards than those who negotiate directly with insurance agents, even for comparable injuries.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1734" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1734" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> How, if at all, does all this affect your view of Rule 7.3?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Instead of the current asymmetry, would a preferable approach be legislation akin to the legislation Congress enacted to protect victims of airline accidents and their families, which bars <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> unsolicited communication—either by an attorney or by “any potential party to the litigation”—for forty-five days following the accident?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1735" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1735" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span> Why do you suppose more states have not adopted this approach?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Though solicitation has long been banned in the United States, it is apparently still quite commonplace. Legendary San Francisco plaintiffs’ attorney Melvin Belli has been quoted as saying: “All the big cases are chased. There’s a hell of a lot of chasing in the United States, brutal and bad, and I think the bar associations are unctuous about it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1736" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1736" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> Supporting Belli’s anecdotal account, a 2004 survey of those who sought third-party compensation following auto accidents reported that, when claimants were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page793" class="pagebreak" title="793">793</span>asked why they talked with an attorney, 4 percent reported that it was because “an attorney contacted our household,” the very same number as reported that they “saw attorney advertising.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1737" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1737" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Though impermissible solicitation appears to be widespread, disciplinary actions for Rule 7.3 violations are rare. According to Professor Anita Bernstein, from 2002 to 2007, only sixty-two out of 1.3 million licensed attorneys were disciplined for solicitation, and, of those, only half of the reported cases “put any emphasis on solicitation.” Instead, solicitation was thrown in “with a behavior about which the bar appears to care more.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1738" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1738" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span> Is this apparent under-enforcement a problem? Is the under-enforcement of ethical proscriptions a recurring theme?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The advent of social media marketing threatens to erase any distinction between advertising and solicitation. Facebook, for example, allows its marketing customers to target advertisements to a very narrow audience. Facebook’s pattern-matching is so precise, in fact, that it can detect private life events, such as recent break-ups or pregnancies.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1739" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1739" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> Conceivably, attorneys could use such technology to “micro-target” advertising such that it reaches only those injured in recent car accidents, or only those feuding spouses who may be likely candidates for a divorce. Should marketing of this sort be regulated under the more permissive rubric of advertising, or as a form of solicitation? <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Rule 7.3(a) (defining solicitation as “a communication initiated by or on behalf of a lawyer or law firm that is directed to a specific person the lawyer knows or reasonably should know needs legal services in a particular matter and that offers to provide, or reasonably can be understood as offering to provide, legal services for that matter”).</p>

The wreath included a firm brochure and a letter to the family stating: “Please accept our deepest sympathy in the loss of Randy. We know that you are presently being faced with many difficult decisions and will soon be faced with others. If we may be of assistance to you in any regard, do not hesitate to contact us.” The state’s prohibitions against solicitation refer only to contact made in person or by phone.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1741" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1741" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">Another way that the market for lawyers is regulated in the United States is via prohibitions on the practice of law by nonlawyers. Though lawyers may employ paraprofessionals and delegate tasks to them under Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.5&quot; \s &quot;5.5&quot; \c 16 " />5.5 (so long as the paraprofessionals are appropriately supervised), nonlawyers may <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> engage in the actual practice law. According to Comment 2 to Rule 5.5, this prohibition is important because “limiting the practice of law to members of the bar protects the public against rendition of legal services by unqualified persons.”<span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Fortifying Rule 5.5, many states make the unauthorized practice of law a criminal misdemeanor. In California, for example, a nonlawyer who practices law is subject to a $1,000 fine or up to one year in county jail, or both.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1743" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1743" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span> States also typically provide that the unauthorized practice of law is a defense to a lawsuit for the payment of fees, so if someone practices law without a license, she need not be paid for her efforts. Like restrictions on attorney advertising and client solicitation, the prohibition on the unauthorized practice of law has also been a site of bitter controversy. </p>

She has advertised in various local newspapers as “Marilyn’s Secretarial Service” offering to perform typing services for “Do-It-Yourself” divorces, wills, resumes, and bankruptcies.

The referee found that respondent, under the guise of a “secretarial” or “typing” service prepares, for a fee, all papers deemed by her to be needed for the pleading, filing, and securing of a dissolution of marriage, as well as detailed instructions as to how the suit should be filed, notice served, hearings set, trial conducted, and the final decree secured. The referee also found that in one instance, respondent prepared a quit claim deed in reference to the marital property of the parties. The referee determined that respondent’s contention that she merely operates a typing service is rebutted by numerous facts in evidence. Ms. Brumbaugh has no blank forms either to sell or to fill out. Rather, she types up the documents for her customers after they have asked her to prepare a petition or an entire set of dissolution of marriage papers. Prior to typing up the papers, respondent asks her customers whether custody, child support, or alimony is involved. Respondent has four sets of dissolution of marriage papers, and she chooses which set is appropriate for the particular customer. She then types out those papers, filling in the blank spaces with the appropriate information. Respondent instructs her customers how the papers are to be signed, where they are to be filed, and how the customer should arrange for a final hearing. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This case does not arise out of a complaint by any of Ms. Brumbaugh’s customers as to improper advice or unethical conduct. It has been initiated by members of The Florida Bar who believe her to be practicing law without a license. The evidence introduced at the hearing below shows that none of respondent’s customers believed that she was an attorney, or that she was acting as an attorney in their behalf. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page797" class="pagebreak" title="797">797</span>Respondent’s advertisements clearly addressed themselves to people who wish to do their own divorces. These customers knew that they had to have “some type of papers” to file in order to obtain their dissolution of marriage. Respondent never handled contested divorces. During the past two years respondent has assisted several hundred customers in obtaining their own divorces. The record shows that while some of her customers told respondent exactly what they wanted, generally respondent would ask her customers for the necessary information needed to fill out the divorce papers, such as the names and addresses of the parties, the place and duration of residency in this state, whether there was any property settlement to be resolved, or any determination as to custody and support of children. Finally, each petition contained the bare allegation that the marriage was irretrievably broken. Respondent would then inform the parties as to which documents needed to be signed, by whom, how many copies of each paper should be filed, where and when they should be filed, the costs involved, and what witness testimony is necessary at the court hearing. Apparently, Ms. Brumbaugh no longer informs the parties verbally as to the proper procedures for the filing of the papers, but offers to let them copy papers described as “suggested procedural education.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Florida Bar argues that the above activities of respondent violate the [past] rulings of this Court. . . . In those decisions we held that it is lawful to sell to the public printed legal forms, provided they do not carry with them what purports to be instructions on how to fill out such forms or how to use them. We stated that legal advice is inextricably involved in the filling out and advice as to how to use such legal forms, and therein lies the danger of injury or damage to the public if not properly performed in accordance with law. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although Marilyn Brumbaugh never held herself out as an attorney, it is clear that her clients placed some reliance upon her to properly prepare the necessary legal forms for their dissolution proceedings. To this extent we believe that Ms. Brumbaugh overstepped proper bounds and engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. We hold that Ms. Brumbaugh, and others in similar situations, may sell printed material purporting to explain legal practice and procedure to the public in general and she may sell sample legal forms. . . . Further, we hold that it is not improper for Marilyn Brumbaugh to engage in a secretarial service, typing such forms for her clients, provided that she only copy the information given to her in writing by her clients. In addition, Ms. Brumbaugh may advertise her business activities of providing secretarial and notary services and selling legal forms and general printed information. However, Marilyn Brumbaugh must not, in conjunction with her business, engage in advising clients as to the various remedies available to them, or otherwise assist them in preparing those forms necessary for a dissolution proceeding. More specifically, Marilyn Brumbaugh may not make inquiries nor answer questions from her <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page798" class="pagebreak" title="798">798</span>clients as to the particular forms which might be necessary, how best to fill out such forms, where to properly file such forms, and how to present necessary evidence at the court hearings. Our specific holding with regard to the dissolution of marriage also applies to other unauthorized legal assistance such as the preparation of wills or real estate transaction documents. While Marilyn Brumbaugh may legally sell forms in these areas, and type up instruments which have been completed by clients, she must not engage in personal legal assistance in conjunction with her business activities, including the correction of errors and omissions. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What constitutes the “practice of law”? Attempts to provide a principled definition have been notably unsuccessful.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1744" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1744" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span> If, as <span style="font-style: italic;">Brumbaugh</span> concludes, the practice of law encompasses giving advice on matters involving legal issues, are professionals such as accountants, real estate brokers, investment counselors, and insurance agents engaged in prohibited practices?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The Rules duck the question entirely, noting, in Comment 2 to Rule 5.5, that “the definition of the practice of law is established by law and varies from one jurisdiction to another.” Many state statutes, which often make unauthorized practice a criminal misdemeanor, are similarly unhelpful.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 9.5pt;" class="Heading3Char"> </span>Some prohibit the unauthorized practice of law without defining it, while others employ a circular approach: The practice of law is what lawyers do.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1745" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1745" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Seeking to provide overdue clarity, in 2002, the ABA created a Task Force on the Model Definition of the Practice of Law. The Task Force proposed that all states adopt a definition of the practice of law reflecting “the basic premise that the practice of law is the application of legal principles and judgment to the circumstances or objectives of another person or entity.” The Task Force further proposed that states and territories should “determine who may provide services that are included within the state’s or territory’s definition of the practice of law and under what circumstances, based upon the potential harm and benefit to the public.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1746" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1746" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Yet, the proposal received harsh criticism from the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Their joint letter to the ABA noted the dark history of unauthorized practice of law (UPL) provisions, which have been used “to protect against perceived incursions by real estate agents, bankers, insurance adjusters, and other groups.” The letter cautioned that the proposed definition “could restrain competition between lawyers and nonlawyers to provide similar services to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page799" class="pagebreak" title="799">799</span>American consumers,” ultimately increasing “costs for consumers and limit[ing] their competitive choices.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1747" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1747" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In response to that and other criticism, in 2003, the ABA’s Task Force recommended simply that every jurisdiction devise its own definition. Still, only about half of jurisdictions have defined the practice of law by statute or court rule, perhaps because, when tasked with coming up with a definition, some jurisdictions encountered serious difficulty.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1748" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1748" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> For example, the task force appointed to define the practice of law in New Hampshire ultimately threw in the towel, admitting that it was “unable to reach a consensus of opinion in order to offer specific findings and recommendations on the practice of law.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1749" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1749" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span> If you were a state bar official charged with drafting a definition, what would you propose?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A typical case under prevailing rules is <a id="dabmci_432d54bc44ee476da7b8394f6481142d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Fifteenth Judicial District Unified Bar Ass’n v. Glasgow</span>, 1999 WL 1128847 (Tenn. App. 1999), which found that a typing service had engaged in unauthorized practice by informing low-income customers where and when papers should be filed and by preparing some quit-claim deeds necessary to divide real property. If you were the lawyer representing the typing service on appeal, what arguments would you make? If you were a judge hearing that appeal, what would you decide? Would your answer depend on the quality and price of services provided or the vulnerability of consumers? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Deborah Rhode reviewed ten years of reported UPL cases and found that only one-quarter of such opinions analyzed whether actual harm occurred or realistically could occur from the unauthorized practice in question. She also conducted a national survey of officials involved in UPL enforcement. That survey found that two-thirds of respondents could not recall a specific case of UPL-caused injury in the past year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1750" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1750" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> Do those findings give you pause? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Looking comparatively, Professor Rhode reports:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Other nations permit nonlawyers to provide legal advice and assist with routine documents, and the evidence available does not suggest that their performance has been inadequate. In a study comparing outcomes for low-income clients in the United Kingdom on matters such as welfare benefits, housing, and employment, nonlawyers generally outperformed lawyers in terms of concrete results and client satisfaction. After reviewing their own and other empirical studies, the authors of that study concluded that “it is specialization, not professional status, which appears to be the best predictor of quality.” Ontario allows licensed paralegals to represent individuals in minor court cases and administrative </span>

      <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin-right: 4.15pt;" class="TextParagraph">

        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In recent years, the number of pro se litigants has surged. Now, only 45 percent of <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> state court cases feature lawyers on both sides; in 55 percent of state court litigation, at least one party proceeds pro se.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1753" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1753" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span> In some areas, rates of pro se representation are even higher. In family law matters (including cases involving divorce, custody, and domestic violence), at least one party appears without a lawyer almost 80 percent of the time.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1754" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1754" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> These trends extend even to federal court: More than 25 percent of civil federal plaintiffs proceed pro se and more than half seek federal appellate review without lawyers’ assistance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1755" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1755" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">To address the crisis of pro se representation, some states have liberalized rules on nonlawyer assistance, so individuals can hire <span style="font-style: italic;">someone</span> to help them navigate the maze that is contemporary civil litigation. For example, several years after <span style="font-style: italic;">Brumbaugh</span>, the Florida Supreme Court adopted a rule permitting nonlawyers to provide oral advice concerning the completion of legal forms approved by the Supreme Court of Florida, though oral communications by nonlawyers are restricted to those “reasonably necessary to elicit factual information to complete the form(s)” and inform the individuals how to file such forms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1756" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1756" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>So too, the Washington Supreme Court has established a licensing system for “limited license technicians” for family law cases. California has passed a “Legal Document Assistant” statute, which allows registered assistants to complete, file, and serve forms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1757" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1757" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span> In July 2019, California also invited public comment on a more robust proposal that would allow certified nonlawyers to dispense legal advice about a limited set of topics.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1758" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1758" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> Arizona similarly permits “certified legal document preparers” to complete and file documents and provide “general legal information” but not “specific advice . . . about legal rights, remedies, defenses, options or strategies.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1759" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1759" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span> In Texas, after a federal district <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page801" class="pagebreak" title="801">801</span>court held that a computer software program, <span style="font-style: italic;">Quicken Family Lawyer</span>, constituted UPL, the Texas Legislature passed a statute excluding such software from prohibited activities if it “clearly and conspicuously” states that it is not a “substitute for the advice of an attorney.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1760" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1760" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>If you were a member of one of these bar commissions or state legislatures, what position would you take on the expansion of nonlawyer services?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Prison litigation is another area that is heavily affected by the pro se crisis. In federal courts, prisoner-initiated lawsuits account for over 65 percent of pro se filings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1761" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1761" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> Inmates who are serving extended sentences are not (typically) licensed to practice law, but some nevertheless develop extensive knowledge of the law through years of work on their own (and their cellmates’) cases. In the 1960s, several states banned these “jailhouse lawyers” from assisting their fellow inmates.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1762" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1762" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span> But in <a id="dabmci_7653f7021f3f41648d23edd36cd1b78a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Johnson v.

Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson v. Avery</span>, 393 U.S. 483 (1969), the Supreme Court held that, at least when habeas corpus is at issue, states cannot forbid all jailhouse lawyering unless they provide a better alternative. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Today, many jurisdictions have softened their attitudes toward such assistance. Several states now provide formal legal education programs that certify inmates to engage in certain forms of legal practice and even pay graduates of these programs to assist their fellow inmates with legal problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1763" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1763" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span> In a 2016 decision, the Vermont Supreme Court rejected the idea that jailhouse lawyering should be regulated under UPL. Incarcerated individuals, the courts reasoned, are “especially disadvantaged in trying to get legal information and advice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1764" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1764" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> And, in 2019, a jailhouse lawyer filed a high-profile case that ultimately reached the Supreme Court.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1765" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1765" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some harshly criticize UPL prohibitions. Deborah Rhode, for example, argues that current UPL restrictions go too far, drive up the cost of routine legal services, and exacerbate the pro se crisis, as outlined above. In Rhode’s view, a sensible regulatory framework would provide both less and more protection—less for attorneys and more for consumers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1766" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1766" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Defenders of UPL prohibitions marshal several arguments in response. The first and most important is that lawyers possess skills that even very knowledgeable nonlawyers lack. Virtually every law school graduate recognizes that the first year or two of law school teaches the hard-to-define knack of “thinking like a lawyer.” Someone who thinks like a lawyer has not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page802" class="pagebreak" title="802">802</span>just mastered legal knowledge. Rather, he or she knows how to (a) view fact situations as “the law” understands them, and (b) differentiate strong from weak legal arguments. These are forms of judgment that come from full and prolonged immersion in the law, and, lawyers argue, there is no shortcut or substitute. Furthermore, even if a nonlawyer acquires substantial expertise in some corner of the law, he or she is likely to miss nuance that a trained lawyer, with a broad knowledge of many fields of law, will catch. Second, defenders of <span style="color: #000000;">UPL restrictions point out that the bar exam offers a valuable screening mechanism intended to ensure a measure of proficiency among lawyers that nonlawyers may lack. Third, the fact that lawyers are governed by an enforceable code of ethics offers clients an extra measure of protection, as does the existence of the attorney-client privilege. Finally, the legal system as a whole benefits by having legal transactions completed at a high level of proficiency—a public good over and above the benefit to clients.</span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Distilling various defenses of UPL regulation, in 2011, the then-president of the ABA wrote the following letter to the </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">New York Times</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;">:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="color: #000000;">The American Bar Association strongly agrees that our nation must expand access to justice for low-income Americans. However, a rush to open the practice of law to unschooled, unregulated nonlawyers is not the solution. This would cause grave harm to clients. Even matters that appear simple, such </span>as uncontested divorces, involve myriad legal rights and responsibilities. If the case is not handled by a professional with appropriate legal training, a person can suffer serious long term consequences affecting loved ones or financial security. . . . We must expand legal services for those in need, provided by first-rate trained lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1767" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1767" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Who has the better argument? If the alternative to the status quo is trained and licensed nonlawyers, does the ABA’s objection hold up? Do these defenses make sense when bar discipline is lax and the bans on nonlawyer practice are under-enforced? Could most of the advantages of licensing for lawyers be achieved by a comprehensive licensing system for independent paralegals?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1768" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1768" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Efforts to legally challenge unauthorized practice provisions have generally foundered. In a typical ruling, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed an order enjoining a form preparation service from providing oral advice. In so ruling, the court summarily rejected a claim that the prohibition impaired constitutionally protected expression. Such an argument, the court reasoned, would call into question many professional licensing and regulatory schemes. <a id="dabmci_38f5fb738292450aacdcefb7d58e47dc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Oregon State Bar v.

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How should unauthorized practice rules apply to authors or publishers of legal texts and treatises? In <span style="font-style: italic;">Matter of New York Co. Lawyers’ Ass’n v. Dacey</span>, Norman Dacey published a popular book entitled, “How to Avoid Probate!,” which consisted of 55 pages of text and 310 pages of forms. The pertinent legal principle was stated as follows:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">It cannot be claimed that the publication of a legal text which purports to say what the law is amounts to legal practice. And the mere fact that the principles or rules stated in the text may be accepted by a particular reader as a solution to his problem does not affect this . . . . Apparently it is urged that the conjoining of these two, that is, the text and the forms, with advice as to how the forms should be filled out, constitutes the unlawful practice of law. But that is the situation with many approved and accepted texts. Dacey’s book is sold to the public at large. There is no personal contact or relationship with a particular individual. Nor does there exist that relation of confidence and trust so necessary to the status of attorney and client. This is the essential of legal practice—the representation and the advising of a particular person in a particular situation . . . . At most the book assumes to offer general advice on common problems, and does not purport to give personal advice on a specific problem peculiar to a designated or readily identified person.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1770" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1770" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span></p>

The company’s website “offered customers extensive advice on how to take advantage of so-called loopholes in the bankruptcy code, promised services comparable to those of a ‘top notch bankruptcy lawyer,’ and described its software as ‘an expert system’ that would do more than function as a ‘customized word processor.<a id="dabmci_0699ea932a724839ad380c06afe088f2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />’ ” 477 F.3d. at 1125.

      <p class="TextParagraph">The bar does not just restrict the practice of nonlawyers. It also restricts licensed lawyers from practicing law outside of their own state’s boundaries. Codified in Rule 5.5(a), this provision provides: “A lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.” Subsection (b) continues:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer who is not admitted to practice in this jurisdiction shall not:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />except as authorized by these Rules or other law, establish an office or other systematic and continuous presence in this jurisdiction for the practice of law; or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />hold out to the public or otherwise represent that the lawyer is admitted to practice law in this jurisdiction.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Subsections (c) and (d) go on to provide that an out-of-state lawyer may furnish legal services only in limited circumstances. For instance, Rule 5.5(c) permits a lawyer licensed in one state to provide <span style="font-style: italic;">temporary</span> legal services in another state if the services are “reasonably related” to the lawyer’s home-state practice. It also permits an out-of-state lawyer to engage in temporary practice if associated with an in-state or admitted <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice </span>(“for this occasion”). Subsection (d) further permits an out-of-state lawyer to provide legal services if: (1) she is providing services to her employer or her employer’s affiliates (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> an in-house lawyer) or (2) federal law or other law so provides. Violation of this Rule counts as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page808" class="pagebreak" title="808">808</span>unauthorized practice of law in the same way that practice by nonlawyers does.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In recent years, these restrictions have come under increasing fire, as many modern legal problems cross state lines. Furthermore, many attorney communications, whether by phone or email, do not remain within the jurisdiction where the attorney is licensed to practice. The traditional work-arounds to out-of-state practice restrictions, including the affiliation of licensed local counsel or temporary admission to practice in court <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice</span>, are also seen as burdensome, unpredictable, costly, and inadequate. As an ABA Commission on Multijurisdictional Practice noted:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Testimony before the Commission was unanimous in recognizing that lawyers commonly engage in cross-border legal practice. Further, there was general consensus that such practice is on the increase and that this trend is not only inevitable, but necessary. The explosion of technology and the increasing complexity of legal practice have resulted in the need for lawyers to cross state borders to afford clients competent representation. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The existing system of lawyer regulation is and should be a matter of serious concern for many lawyers. Even in contexts where jurisdictional restrictions clearly apply, as in state-court proceedings, problems are caused by the lack of uniformity among the <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice</span> provisions of different states, unpredictability about how some of the provisions will be applied by the courts in individual cases, and, in some cases, the provisions’ excessive restrictiveness. Of even greater concern, however, is that, outside the context of litigation, the reach of the jurisdictional restrictions is vastly uncertain as well as, potentially, far too restrictive. . . . The existing system of lawyer regulation has costs for clients. For example, out of concern for jurisdictional restrictions, lawyers may decline to provide services that they are able to render skillfully and ethically.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1781" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1781" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span></p>

McCarney</span>, 391 N.W.2d 161 (N.D. 1986), is a leading decision on multijurisdictional practice. In the case, an attorney named Esko Ranta, licensed to practice in Minnesota, brought an action against a former client, who resided in North Dakota, to recover fees for legal services Ranta had performed. Specifically, Ranta had traveled to North Dakota to provide the client federal tax advice in connection with the sale of a North Dakota business. On appeal, the Supreme Court of North Dakota held that Ranta had violated North Dakota’s UPL statute, and the client, as a consequence, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page809" class="pagebreak" title="809">809</span>was not obligated to pay for the work Ranta had completed. In the court’s words:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Although our statutory law does not specifically prohibit compensation of out-of-State attorneys who practice law in the State . . . , the statute is clearly intended to provide protection to our citizens from unlicensed and unauthorized practice of law. . . . North Dakota has a compelling interest in regulating the practice of law within its boundaries . . . [and the relevant statute] is aimed at preventing the harm caused by unqualified persons performing legal services for others.

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The dissent argued that the point of UPL provisions was to protect the public, and that the only individuals protected by the majority’s ruling were North Dakota attorneys and a client who had profited from Ranta’s assistance.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">How would you have decided the case? May a lawyer admitted only in Minnesota give advice by telephone or email to a client living in North Dakota? What if the advice involves Minnesota or federal law? Does it matter whether the lawyer provides that advice while physically located in Minnesota?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another leading case is <a id="dabmci_fd5275fe792f43f28080259b538a9d96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon &amp; Frank v. Superior Court</span>, 949 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1998). Birbrower was a New York firm that had represented the Sandhu family in various business matters since 1986. One such matter involved a marketing agreement between Tandem Corporation and ESQ Business Services (ESQ-NY), a New York business software producer owned by Kamal Sandhu. Sandhu’s brother subsequently became the primary shareholder of a California corporation with the same name (ESQ-Cal). In 1992, the two corporations hired Birbrower to resolve a dispute with Tandem. The original fee agreement was made in New York and modified in California. Over the course of the representation, Birbrower’s lawyer made three brief trips of several days each to California to confer with ESQ officers, to negotiate with Tandem representatives, and to initiate arbitration proceedings. The dispute was ultimately settled before arbitration.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">After the dispute was resolved, ESQ-Cal sued Birbrower for malpractice. Birbrower cross-claimed to recover the firm’s unpaid fee. The trial court granted the plaintiff’s (ESQ-Cal’s) motion for summary judgment on the ground that the fee agreement was unenforceable because Birbrower had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The California Supreme Court affirmed. Under the court’s analysis, the “primary inquiry is whether the unlicensed lawyer engaged in sufficient activities in the state or created a continuing relationship with the California client that included legal duties and obligations.” Physical presence, according to the court, was a relevant but not conclusive factor. Lawyers could engage in unauthorized practice by providing legal advice by telephone, fax, or other means. In the court’s view, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page810" class="pagebreak" title="810">810</span>the Birbrower lawyers’ “extensive practice” in California was sufficient to establish a violation.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The <a id="dabmci_c6073f76c2344e8dbf91a929be6192a0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Birbrower</span> decision attracted widespread criticism, which the California legislature partially addressed by creating a statutory exemption from unauthorized practice prohibitions for arbitration proceedings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1783" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1783" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> The California Supreme Court also appointed a committee to recommend further changes and ultimately enacted rules (similar to the amended Rule 5.5) that allow limited practice by registered in-house and legal aid attorneys who are duly licensed in another jurisdiction, as well as out-of-state attorneys temporarily in California for litigation or transactional matters.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1784" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1784" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span> To qualify for the temporary legal assistance exemption, the attorney must not maintain an office or a “continuous presence in California for the practice of law” or “regularly engage in substantial business or professional activities in California.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1785" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1785" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span> What implications do you draw from the <a id="dabmci_2fb42c886ba44dae8662b255d286b645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Birbrower</span> decision?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the ABA created a new Model Court Rule on the Provision of Legal Services Following Determination of Major Disaster. Now referenced in Comment 15 to Rule 5.5, this provision eases UPL restrictions if the state’s highest court decides a bona fide emergency (such as one caused by a flood, earthquake, tsunami, or terrorist attack) exists. If such a ruling is made, displaced lawyers from the affected jurisdiction may practice in a new jurisdiction for a limited period, not to exceed 365 days, while they pursue formal admission to a new bar. Licensed out-of-state lawyers are also permitted to provide pro bono assistance to affected in-state individuals, without regard to UPL restrictions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1786" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1786" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some commentators believe that Rule 5.5 is unduly complex and restrictive. A number of alternatives are possible. Colorado allows lawyers who are licensed in another jurisdiction to practice in the state up to the point of litigation, as long as they do not become domiciled or open an office in the state. Since that rule went into effect in 2003, only a handful of out-of-state lawyers have been disciplined. In testimony before the ABA’s Ethics 20/20 Commission, Colorado’s chief deputy counsel of attorney regulation explained that the rule has “worked well.” “The sky hasn’t fallen.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1787" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1787" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span> Then-ABA President Carolyn Lamm responded, however, that expanding such an approach would impair the Commission’s credibility and would “not go over in the ABA House of Delegates.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1788" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1788" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page811" class="pagebreak" title="811">811</span>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">States could alternatively follow the approach set forth in the <a id="dabmci_7eaabafc043849458aa4e3f99b9b49b1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </span>§ 3. It provides:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">A lawyer currently admitted to practice in a jurisdiction may provide legal services to a client:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />at any place within the admitting jurisdiction;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />before a tribunal or administrative agency of another jurisdiction or the federal government in compliance with requirements for temporary or regular admission to practice before that tribunal or agency; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />at a place within a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is not admitted to the extent that the lawyer’s activities arise out of or are otherwise reasonably related to the lawyer’s practice under Subsection (1) or (2).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Other possibilities include: a national system of bar admission, discussed in Chapter 15; more permissive state-based reciprocity rules modeled on the European Union system; or a “Common Sense Proposal” to permit legal services on a temporary basis by out-of-state attorneys.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1789" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1789" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> Under a national bar admission system, a license to practice law would be similar to a driver’s license; the attorney’s state of residence would test for competence, and other jurisdictions would honor its judgment as long as the attorney’s presence is temporary. Under a system like that of the European Union, lawyers could provide legal services in another jurisdiction if they register, limit their practice to occasional activity, agree to comply with local ethics rules and enforcement processes, and maintain legal malpractice insurance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1790" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1790" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span> Do any of these approaches appear to be preferable to the current system?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The World Trade Organization estimates that the global market for legal services eclipses $550 billion annually and, in recent years, overseas work has been a significant and growing source of revenue for U.S. firms. In the 1990s and 2000s, “the growth of overseas activities of the largest U.S.-based law firms . . . far outpaced their growth within the United States, by a rate of ten-to-one.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1791" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1791" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span> And, in the last decade, firms on the Am Law 200 list have added nearly 200 overseas offices and more than 6,600 overseas lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1792" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1792" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span> As trade borders fall, there are increasing calls to further reduce barriers to transnational legal practice. Many experts believe that unless nations better adapt their regulatory structures to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page812" class="pagebreak" title="812">812</span>global and technological developments, their economies and their professions will suffer. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These calls have met with mixed success, as nations vary widely in their receptiveness to foreign attorneys. Some are quite open to global practice, while others are highly restrictive and make it impossible, or nearly impossible, for foreign lawyers to practice within their borders.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1793" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1793" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">132</a></span> The United States falls somewhere in between, as foreign practice is sometimes permitted, though certain barriers—including expansive unauthorized practice restrictions and substantial state-to-state rule variations—impose formidable obstacles.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1794" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1794" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">133</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), a multilateral treaty that applies to cross-border legal services in all 160+ World Trade Organization Member States, provides a forum in which countries can discuss legal services barriers. According to a 2010 WTO report, seventy-six WTO Member States, including the United States, included legal services in their Schedule of Specific Commitments. A country that includes legal services in its Schedule assumes additional opt-in obligations, such as disclosure of some of its limits on foreign service providers, and a requirement to comply with domestic regulation “disciplines” that require qualification and licensing standards to be based “on objective and transparent criteria” that are “not more burdensome than necessary.” </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Article XIX of the GATS also requires WTO countries to conduct negotiations to further liberalize trade. Those negotiations are proceeding slowly. In the United States, efforts have included expansion of rules allowing foreign legal consultants. More than thirty states have such rules, which enable lawyers from other countries who are not licensed in the United States to provide services related to the laws of their home country (and in some jurisdictions, also international law).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1795" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1795" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">134</a></span> The European Union has extremely liberal rules that allow cross-border practice by lawyers from one EU Member State in another EU Member State. Some EU jurisdictions, such as Ireland, also have liberal rules on admission of foreign attorneys from outside the EU. The International Bar Association and the CCBE, which is the organization that represents the EU’s legal professions, have undertaken efforts to harmonize codes of conduct. Initiatives such as these are likely to have growing influence <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page813" class="pagebreak" title="813">813</span>as more lawyers engage in transnational practice and as countries further discuss the legal services’ sections of their international trade agreements.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Several countries have enacted laws to protect their own corporations from lawsuits in U.S. courts by forbidding companies and their lawyers from complying with U.S. discovery requests. For example, in 1980, the French Parliament concluded that French businesses were being harmed by aggressive discovery tactics by foreign lawyers whose clients were suing French businesses. In response, France enacted a criminal law, Law No. 80–538, which provides as follows:<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1796" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1796" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">135</a></span></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Article 1. No person may request, seek to obtain or transmit, in writing, orally or in any other form, documents or information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature, intended for the constitution of evidence in connection with pending or prospective foreign judicial or administrative proceedings. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Article 3. Without prejudice to any heavier penalties that may be provided by law, any violation of the provisions of Articles 1 shall be punished by imprisonment of from two to six months and a fine.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">(Under French law, criminal provisions carrying imprisonment as a punishment may be applied outside of France.) </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">France does allow foreign discovery—but only under an extremely slow and cumbersome procedure. The party seeking discovery must go to its own national court, which issues letters (called “Letters of Request” or “Letters Rogatory”) to its national consulate in France, which in turn sends the request to the French Ministry of Justice. The foreign court has no power to monitor this discovery process, and French courts will enforce the request according to French law, not the law of the requesting state.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Consider the plight of Karin, a French lawyer, licensed to practice law in both France and New York. Karin is defending a French company, Widgets Lyonnais (WL), against a personal injury lawsuit filed in New York based on defective widgets, alleged to have harmed the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs serve a discovery request on WL, but, citing the Blocking Statute, Karin refuses to tender the requested documents. Plaintiffs move to compel, and the New York judge holds a hearing on whether WL and Karin’s firm must comply with U.S. discovery. The New York court rules in the affirmative and grants plaintiffs’ motion to compel. It rules that WL must provide the information; if it refuses, the court will enter a default judgment against WL and will sanction Karin for discovery <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page814" class="pagebreak" title="814">814</span>abuse and report Karin for professional discipline. WL instructs Karin to comply with discovery, but such compliance will subject Karin to criminal prosecution in France—and in a widely-publicized 2007 case, a lawyer was indeed prosecuted for complying with a foreign discovery request. What should Karin do?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Some bar ethics committees have issued opinions in response, and these, together with other opinions addressing the use of domestic contract attorneys, suggest certain precautions regarding competence, consent, confidentiality, and conflicts. First, before delegating work to offshore lawyers, the supervising lawyer needs to ensure that the work will be competently performed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1801" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1801" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">140</a></span> To ensure that performance is adequate, lawyers should consider: the nature of the services assigned, the legal protections and ethical rules of the jurisdiction in which the services will be performed, and the nonfirm lawyers’ education, training, and experience. Supervising lawyers must also monitor overseas practitioners to ensure that they are diligently and faithfully discharging their responsibilities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1802" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1802" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a></span> Second, before a lawyer retains or contracts with nonfirm lawyers, the supervising lawyer must typically obtain the client’s informed consent or, at the very least per Rule 1.4, communicate with the client regarding the retention and delegation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1803" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1803" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">142</a></span> Third, a lawyer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page815" class="pagebreak" title="815">815</span>sending work overseas must be attuned to client confidentiality, as mandated by Rule 1.6. Other nations have different rules concerning confidentiality, and it is not entirely clear how American rules governing the attorney-client privilege apply overseas.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1804" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1804" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">143</a></span> Lawyers who outsource legal work need to take special measures to safeguard sensitive information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1805" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1805" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">144</a></span> Finally, as work moves overseas, conflicts become a particular concern. The ABA Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility has concluded that temporary contract attorneys are still subject to Rules 1.7 and 1.9, which govern conflicts of interest involving current and former clients, respectively.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1806" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1806" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">145</a></span> Whether Rule 1.10 and prevailing court opinions would require vicarious disqualification would depend on the precise factual circumstances, such as the temporary attorney’s access to confidential information and the extent of the overseas lawyer’s involvement with the supervising law firm.<a id="_Toc335223415" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732207" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733046" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733205" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339368991" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369149" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486606" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486765" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1807" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1807" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">146</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Over the last quarter-century, two additional and related issues have assumed increasing importance: lawyers’ involvement in nonlegal “ancillary” businesses and nonlawyer investment in law firms. Neither of these issues reflects entirely new developments. Some attorneys have long engaged in activities tangential to legal practice, such as selling insurance or providing investment advice. And lawyers have long worked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page816" class="pagebreak" title="816">816</span>for multidisciplinary accounting firms and other nonlawyer-owned entities. But recent trends reveal cross-professional alliances on a larger scale. Faced with increasing competition for clients, a growing desire to harness economies of scale, and clients’ growing demand for integrated legal <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> nonlegal advice, more lawyers are forging closer relationships with other professionals—and many favor easing current restraints.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc39756640" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908774" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Multidisciplinary Practice</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other western industrialized nations generally permit nonlawyers to form partnerships with lawyers. By contrast, in the United States, Rule 5.4’s general prohibition on multidisciplinary practices (MDPs) aims to protect the “Professional Independence of a Lawyer.” Rule 5.4(b) provides: “A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law,” while Section (d) admonishes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit, if:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time during administration;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof or occupies the position of similar responsibility in any form of association other than a corporation; or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The propriety of these restrictions is a matter of hot debate. Critics of MDP (who support the status quo) argue that lines are drawn where they ought to be, as diversification into non-legal activity distracts lawyers from the practice of law, impairs their objectivity, invites misuse of confidential information, and erodes the distinctiveness of law as a profession. Critics also worry that if nonlawyers are permitted to become firm partners, lawyers will become accountable to supervisors from a different tradition with less rigorous standards governing confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and pro bono service. In their view, as disciplinary boundaries blur and thin, law will become just another business, and clients will pay the price as professional judgments are driven by the bottom line.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Proponents of MDP (who favor relaxing Rule 5.4’s restrictions), by contrast, stress the advantages to clients of “one-stop” shopping and the benefits to lawyers of being able to attract additional expertise. The benefits, proponents believe, would extend not just to large firms and business clients, but to small firms and sole practitioners serving individuals whose needs cut across multiple fields. Proponents further <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page817" class="pagebreak" title="817">817</span>argue that these activities encourage cost-effective collaborations between lawyers and nonlawyer experts, decrease search costs in hiring such experts, and give lawyers stronger incentives to monitor the services of affiliated professionals. Responding to ethics concerns, proponents suggest critics’ concerns are exaggerated and that, even if it <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">conceivably</span> be established that conflicts and confidentiality problems were more likely to arise in multidisciplinary firms, it is far from self-evident that total prohibition is the best response.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1809" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1809" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">148</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 1999, an ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice weighed in to acknowledge critics’ ethical concerns and to propose strategies to address them short of prohibition. The Commission recommended holding nonlawyers in MDPs to the same ethical standards as those applicable to the bar generally. In addition, the Commission proposed special audit provisions to prevent nonlawyers from interfering with lawyers’ independent professional judgments.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1810" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1810" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">149</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ABA House of Delegates considered, but twice rejected, the Commission’s recommendations, refusing to relax prohibitions on multidisciplinary partnerships in the absence of evidence that they would serve the public interest and would not compromise the profession’s independence or loyalty to clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1811" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1811" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a></span> During the House of Delegates’ debates, lawyers who had worked in both law firms and MDPs testified to the absence of significant differences between the ethical cultures of the two organizations, apart from the rules about imputed conflicts of interest. Representatives from MDPs also testified and pointed to records of pro bono service that rivaled those of law firms—but the House of Delegates apparently found this evidence insufficient.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Even without the House of Delegates’ blessing, however, there are some limited moves to permit more MDPs. For one, federal law provides that the giving of tax advice and even representation in tax court do not constitute the practice of law. This exemption enables lawyers to provide services for clients of accounting firms, as long as the work can be defined as “tax,” not legal, assistance. Over the past decade, accounting firms have taken increasing liberties with that definition and have expanded their in-house legal staff to provide much the same services as law firms on matters such as tax, financial, and estate planning, intellectual property, alternative dispute resolution, and litigation support.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The District of Columbia Bar, meanwhile, has pioneered rules on ancillary business and also permits nonlawyers to become firm partners under specified circumstances. As a result, prominent D.C. law firms have formed subsidiaries or quasi-independent business groups within <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page818" class="pagebreak" title="818">818</span>the firm. Major areas of concentration have included financial management and investment, international trade, lobbying, real estate, and employee benefits. Increasing numbers of lawyers have also begun experimenting with “one-stop” services for individual as well as corporate clients; a representative example is a law office that employs or affiliates with medical and social workers to assist senior citizens.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Similarly, New York now permits lawyers to develop “strategic alliances” with other professional service providers. Under these alliances, the firms and other providers agree to share clients and sometimes capital.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1812" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1812" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">151</a></span> In other jurisdictions, lawyers and nonlawyers provide holistic services through collaborative arrangements that do not involve fee sharing. Whether these arrangements can address client needs as effectively as fully integrated MDPs remains to be seen.</p>

In that case, a trade association representing North Carolina employers had lawyers on its staff, and it wanted its lawyers to be able to answer questions about labor law and draft legal documents (e.g., contracts and employment handbooks) for its members. The trade association reported that, if permitted, it “would offer most legal services without charge as part of its membership fees, but it would charge hourly fees for certain services.” <a id="dabmci_69c07f28a03348b39bef46b72eb49522" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />922 F.3d at 202–03. The association was stymied in offering these services, however, by North Carolina’s restrictions on MDP which prevented corporate entities—including non-profits and voluntary associations—from employing licensed attorneys to provide legal advice to third parties.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The trade association thus sued, seeking a declaratory judgment that North Carolina’s restriction on MDP, as applied to the association, violated its freedom of association and unlawfully burdened its speech. The Court of Appeals ultimately rejected the association’s challenge. In its view, North Carolina’s ban on MDP satisfied intermediate scrutiny because the state’s “interest in regulating the legal profession to protect clients is at least substantial” and because the prohibition was “sufficiently drawn” to protect that interest.<span class="FootnoteReference"> </span><a id="dabmci_b7206dea20a84be194509348139e8267" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 209.

According to Geoffrey Hazard, reporter for the Model Rules Commission: “During the debate [in the ABA’s House of Delegates] someone asked if [this provision] would allow Sears Roebuck to open a law office. When [bar members] found out it would, that was the end of the debate.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1813" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1813" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">152</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Should it have been?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In the U.S., lawyers are also barred from acquiring capital from nonlawyers per Rule 5.4(a), which provides that a “lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer,” except in one of a few exceptional circumstances. Owing to Rule 5.4(a), in the U.S., “the only way that an attorney can raise capital is either by investing her own funds or borrowing.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1816" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1816" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">155</a></span> Or, as Professor Gillian Hadfield has put it:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[Attorneys are] restricted to the plowed-back profits and owner-manager mechanisms that financed companies in the late-nineteenth century before the advent of the modern corporation, which brought with it the separation of ownership and control and the explosion of stock markets and financial institutions that prompted significant economic growth in the first part of the twentieth century.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1817" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1817" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">156</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The rationale for this prohibition is that nonlawyer investors might “not be bound by the same sense of professional responsibility and might push the lawyers to do things that they should not be doing to chase the dollar rather than abiding by the rules of professional conduct.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1818" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1818" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">157</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This prohibition, however, does not obviate lawyers’ need for financing and capital. Professor Anthony Sebok, for example, contends that the restriction only causes lawyers to borrow large sums from outside lenders.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1819" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1819" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">158</a></span> This borrowing makes firms vulnerable to bankruptcy, and, to the extent that law firms borrow from lenders, lenders may exercise intrusive control over firms’ decisions and operations. Sebok elaborates:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The control exercised by a lender can be more than just the power to exercise liens it has on property in the event of default. It could be actively exercised during the life of the loan and in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page820" class="pagebreak" title="820">820</span>order to govern decisions that are conventionally associated with the management of the practice of law by attorneys, including the deployment of manpower and other resources on behalf of current clients. Lenders like Citigroup, which already use covenants to force attorneys to “control[ ] . . . discretionary spending, cut[ ] bonuses, freez[e] associate salaries, postpone[e] new hires or initiatives, lay[ ] off professional and administrative staff, and revamp[ ] partner compensation schedules,” could go even further and instruct attorneys about the staffing of cases, the pricing of motions, and even whether to withdraw from representation of certain clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1820" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1820" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">159</a></span></p>
      <p style="margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextParagraph">Professor Hadfield, a lawyer and economist, adds that the restriction hobbles innovation and limits providers’ ability to develop and finance innovative solutions to legal problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1821" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1821" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">160</a></span> She writes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">To reduce the cost of law and increase access to legal assistance, the form in which legal services are produced and delivered to the market has to change. This will require much larger scale organizations and more creative and complex financial and management relationships between those who provide legal expertise—lawyers—and those who provide many of the other components that go into ultimately delivering legal assistance to people. In this law is just like another modern complex service: medicine. Costs in health care have been controlled only as a result of substantial organizational innovation. By restricting the organizational and contractual structure of law to conventional solo and small firm practice, the legal profession ensures that the changes necessary to make legal help more affordable to ordinary Americans will not occur.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1822" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1822" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">161</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2011, the ABA Ethics 20/20 Commission considered a proposal to allow limited nonlawyer investment. Opposing the proposal, one commentator asked, “Do we really want Walmart or Merrill Lynch to own our law firms?”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1823" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1823" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">162</a></span> If not, why not? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the experience of England, Wales, and Australia. Recently, most of Australia has authorized the creation of alternative practice structures that allow “incorporated legal practices” (called ILPs), which permit ownership interests by nonlawyers and lawyers alike. New South <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page821" class="pagebreak" title="821">821</span>Wales, Australia, now has over a thousand such practices.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1824" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1824" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">163</a></span> <span class="N">Under this framework, ILPs </span>must have at least one practitioner director responsible for creating systems that ensure compliance with professional conduct rules. Directors who fail to take “all reasonable steps” to meet their obligations are subject to disciplinary sanctions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1825" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1825" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">164</a></span> The first Australian publicly traded firm, Slater &amp; Gordon, adds additional safeguards. It discloses in its prospectus that its lawyers’ duties to clients and the court supersede the financial interests of investors, and it provides protections for public interest commitments. According to the executive director of Slater &amp; Gordon, nonlawyer ownership has not proven a threat to ethical values or professional independence. If anything, he believes, separating ownership from legal practice has given lawyers more, not less, distance from business pressures.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1826" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1826" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">165</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The United Kingdom, meanwhile, allows alternative business structures (ABS) regulated by a Legal Services Board. These structures allow nonlawyers to be involved in the investment, ownership, and/or management of the firm, which means that grocery stores can deliver legal services, subject to appropriate safeguards. Several United States firms have converted their London offices to Legal Disciplinary Partnerships, a form of ABS that permits up to a quarter of nonlawyer partners.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1827" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1827" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">166</a></span> A comprehensive 2014 report found that the “dire predictions about a collapse in ethics and reduction in access to justice as a result of ABS have not materialised. There have been no major disciplinary failings by ABS firms or unusual levels of complaints . . . .”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1828" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1828" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">167</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2011, the plaintiff-side law firm Jacoby &amp; Meyers initiated a series of lawsuits challenging Rule 5.4, which prevents nonlawyers from owning an equity share in law firms. The suits claimed that the rule unconstitutionally restricted interstate commerce; burdened the firm’s First Amendment rights to associate with clients; prevented it from raising the capital necessary to invest in improvements in technology and infrastructure, expand its offices and hire additional personnel; and, given all the above, that the rule “perpetuate[d] economic inequity” because a “small practice does not have access to the capital markets that the Wall Street firms have.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1829" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1829" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">168</a></span> Though initiated with great fanfare, the suits made little headway. Some were voluntarily dismissed, and the Second Circuit ultimately held that Rule 5.4 passed “muster” because it “serve[d] New York State’s well-established <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page822" class="pagebreak" title="822">822</span>interest in regulating attorney conduct and in maintaining ethical behavior and independence among the members of the legal profession.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1830" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1830" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">169</a></span> Undaunted, Jacoby &amp; Meyers is working with European firms to expand to the United Kingdom. Said firm founder, Len Jacoby: “ ‘Our ability to raise the capital to serve the public is severely restricted in the U.S. by an outdated Rule of Professional Conduct. Now a significant part of our growth strategy will be based in London.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1831" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1831" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">170</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does the ban on nonlawyer investment affect all firms the same way? Or, are some firms (such as start-ups or personal injury firms, which typically front the costs and expenses of litigation and bear those costs in the event of a loss) disproportionately affected?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1832" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1832" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">171</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When assessing whether to retain Rule 5.4(a), many regulators ask whether a lawyer is apt to be more independent if she is employed at a lawyer-owned versus nonlawyer-owned firm.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Of all the public’s complaints about lawyers, expense tops the list. About three-fifths of Americans describe attorneys as greedy and fewer than 5 percent believe that clients get good value for the price of legal services.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1835" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1835" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">174</a></span> In response to these and other concerns, the U.S. has long sought to control legal fees, but its history of fee regulation reveals a checkered pattern of deference to market forces, price-fixing agreements among lawyers, and occasional legislative and judicial oversight. In evaluating this regulatory pattern, it is appropriate to consider what approaches will best accommodate an array of interests: protecting clients against overreach, encouraging competent and efficient professional services, and maximizing access to the law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Practices surrounding the collection of legal fees have long aroused discomfort among both lawyers and clients. In England, early traditions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page823" class="pagebreak" title="823">823</span>held that gentlemen did not pay other gentlemen for their services.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1836" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1836" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">175</a></span> Accordingly, barristers, the elite of the profession, never discussed fees with their clients; all commercial matters were handled through solicitors and clerks. In this country, the absence of a comparable status division among practitioners made analogous fee conventions impractical. However, many attorneys attempted to distance themselves from the more sordid commercial aspects of their profession by declining to “haggle” with their clients over money. The profession’s distaste for bargaining over fees was also apparent in its earliest Canons of Ethics’ condemnation of “underbidding” and the bar’s subsequent encouragement of minimum fee schedules, which set minimum prices for particular legal services.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1837" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1837" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">176</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Minimum fee schedules became popular during the 1950s and, by the early 1970s, they were utilized by thirty-four states, more than 700 local bar associations, and the majority of practicing lawyers. But in <a id="dabmci_12863328369e4eedbfad40e05976a327" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Goldfarb v.

Virginia State Bar</span>, 421 U.S. 773 (1975), a unanimous Supreme Court invalidated these restrictions. Speaking through Chief Justice Burger, the Court held that “learned professions” involved “trade or commerce” within the scope of federal antitrust legislation, and a profession’s promulgation of a minimum fee schedule, enforced through disciplinary action, constituted an unlawful restraint of trade. <a id="dabmci_dafe3a46847845fabc5b36d26905f57b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />421 U.S. at 787. Yet, <span style="font-style: italic;">Goldfarb</span> hardly constitutes the last word on legal fees in the United States. Nearly half-a-century after that decision, society’s and the profession’s interest in fees—and the reasonableness of legal fees—endures.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">These days in the United States, there are four main types of fee arrangements: (1) the hourly fee; (2) a flat fee for a particular matter; (3) a proportional fee, such as a percentage of an estate or property involved in a transaction; and (4) a contingent fee, which provides for a fee the size or payment of which is conditioned on some measure of the client’s success. Such billing methods can also be used in combination (i.e<span style="font-style: italic;">.,</span> a “blended fee”), or adjusted to incorporate certain incentives (e.g., a flat fee with a bonus for a particular result).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under Rule 1.5, lawyers’ fees must not be “unreasonable.” The Rule provides:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">Charging an excessive fee could, theoretically, subject a lawyer to professional discipline. In practice, however, disciplinary committees tend not to impose sanctions on lawyers for excessive fees, unless the amount charged is so excessive as to appear unconscionable or equivalent to a misappropriation of funds.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1838" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1838" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">177</a></span> Demonstrating the infrequency of bar disciplinary actions for excessive fees, the following case is the first Massachusetts decision disciplining a lawyer on this basis.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">This is an appeal from the Board of Bar Overseers’ (board’s) dismissal of a petition for discipline filed by bar counsel against attorney Laurence S. Fordham. On March 11, 1992, bar counsel served Fordham with a petition for discipline alleging that Fordham had charged a clearly excessive fee . . . for defending Timothy Clark (Timothy) in the District Court against a charge that he operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI) and against other related charges. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After five days of hearings, and with “serious reservations,” the hearing committee concluded that Fordham’s fee was not substantially in excess of a reasonable fee and that, therefore, the committee recommended against bar discipline. Bar counsel appealed from that determination to the board. By a vote of six to five, with one abstention, that board accepted the recommendation of the hearing committee and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page825" class="pagebreak" title="825">825</span>dismissed the petition for discipline. Bar counsel then filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County (county court) a claim of appeal from the board’s action. . . . We conclude . . . that the board erred in dismissing bar counsel’s petition for discipline. We direct a judgment ordering public censure be entered in the county court.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We summarize the hearing committee’s findings. On March 4, 1989, the Acton police department arrested Timothy, then twenty-one years old, and charged him with OUI, operating a motor vehicle after suspension, speeding, and operating an unregistered motor vehicle. At the time of the arrest, the police discovered a partially full quart of vodka in the vehicle. After failing a field sobriety test, Timothy was taken to the Acton police station where he submitted to two breathalyzer tests which registered .10 and .12 respectively.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Subsequent to Timothy’s arraignment, he and his father, Laurence Clark (Clark) consulted with three lawyers, who offered to represent Timothy for fees between $3,000 and $10,000. Shortly after the arrest, Clark went to Fordham’s home to service an alarm system which he had installed several years before. While there, Clark discussed Timothy’s arrest with Fordham’s wife who invited Clark to discuss the case with Fordham. Fordham then met with Clark and Timothy.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At this meeting, Timothy described the incidents leading to his arrest and the charges against him. Fordham, whom the hearing committee described as a “very experienced senior trial attorney with impressive credentials,” told Clark and Timothy that he had never represented a client in a driving while under the influence case or in any criminal matter, and he had never tried a case in the District Court. The hearing committee found that “Fordham explained that although he lacked experience in this area, he was a knowledgeable and hard-working attorney and that he believed he could competently represent Timothy.” Fordham, described himself as “efficient and economic in the use of [his] time.” . . . Towards the end of the meeting, Fordham told the Clarks that he worked on [a] time charge basis and that he billed monthly. . . . After the meeting, Clark hired Fordham to represent Timothy.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to the hearing committee’s findings, Fordham filed four pretrial motions on Timothy’s behalf, two of which were allowed. . . . [At the bench trial] [t]he judge found Timothy not guilty of driving while under the influence. . . . [Fordham sent six monthly bills.] The bills totaled $50,022.25, reflecting 227 hours of billed time, 153 hours of which were expended by Fordham and seventy-four of which were his associates’ time. Clark did not pay the first two bills when they became due and expressed to Fordham his concern about their amount. Clark paid Fordham $10,000 on June 20, 1989. At that time, Fordham assured Clark that most of the work had been completed, “other than taking [the case] to trial.” Clark did not make any subsequent payments. Fordham requested Clark to sign a promissory note evidencing his debt to Fordham and, on October 7, 1989, Clark did so. In the October 13, 1989 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page826" class="pagebreak" title="826">826</span>bill, Fordham added a charge of $5,000 as a “retroactive increase” in fees. On November Fordham, sent Clark a bill for $15,000. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In concluding that Fordham did not charge a clearly excessive fee, the board adopted, with limited exception, the hearing committee’s report. The board’s and the hearing committee’s reasons for dismissing the petition are as follows: Bar counsel and Fordham stipulated that Fordham acted conscientiously, diligently, and in good faith in his representation of the client and his billing on the case. Although Fordham lacked experience in criminal law, he is a “seasoned and well-respected civil lawyer.” The more than 200 hours spent preparing the OUI case were necessary “in part to educate [Fordham] in the relevant substantive law and court procedures,” because he had never tried an OUI case or appeared in the District Court. The board noted that “[al]though none of the experts who testified at the disciplinary hearing had ever heard of a fee in excess of $15,000 for a first-offense OUI case, the hearing committee found that [Clark] had entered into the transaction with open eyes after interviewing other lawyers with more experience in such matters.” The board also thought significant that Clark “later acquiesced, despite mild expressions of concern, in [Fordham’s] billing practices.” Moreover, the Clarks specifically instructed Fordham that they would not consider a guilty plea by Timothy. Rather they were interested only in pursuing the case to trial. Finally, Timothy obtained the result he sought: an acquittal. . . . “In the instant case we are persuaded that the hearing committee’s and the board’s determinations that a clearly excessive fee was not charged are not warranted.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The first factor listed in [the relevant Rule] requires examining “[t]he time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.” Although the hearing committee determined that Fordham “spent a large number of hours on [the] matter, in essence learning from scratch what others . . . already knew,” it “[did] not credit Bar Counsel’s argument that Fordham violated [the Rule] by spending too many hours.” . . . We disagree.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Four witnesses testified before the hearing committee as experts on OUI cases. One of the experts, testifying on behalf of bar counsel, opined that “the amount of time spent in this case is clearly excessive.” He testified that there were no unusual circumstances in the OUI charge against Timothy and that it was a “standard operating under the influence case.” The witness did agree that Fordham’s argument for suppression of the breathalyzer test results, which was successful, was novel and would have justified additional time and labor. He also acknowledged that the acquittal was a good result; even with the suppression of the breathalyzer tests, he testified, the chances of an acquittal would have been “[n]ot likely at a bench trial.” The witness estimated that it would have been necessary, for thorough preparation of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page827" class="pagebreak" title="827">827</span>the case including the novel breathalyzer suppression argument, to have billed twenty to thirty hours for preparation, not including trial time.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A second expert, testifying on behalf of bar counsel, expressed his belief that the issues presented in this case were not particularly difficult, nor novel, and that “[t]he degree of skill required to defend a case such as this . . . was not that high.” He did recognize, however, that the theory that Fordham utilized to suppress the breathalyzer tests was impressive and one of which he had previously never heard. Nonetheless, the witness concluded that “clearly there is no way that [he] could justify these kind of hours to do this kind of work.” He estimated that an OUI case involving these types of issues would require sixteen hours of trial preparation and approximately fifteen hours of trial time. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An expert called by Fordham testified that the facts of Timothy’s case presented a challenge and that without the suppression of the breathalyzer test results it would have been “an almost impossible situation in terms of prevailing on the trier of fact.” He further stated that, based on the particulars in Timothy’s case, he believed that Fordham’s hours were not excessive and, in fact, he, the witness, would have spent a comparable amount of time. The witness later admitted, however, that within the past five years, the OUI cases which he had brought to trial required no more than a total of forty billed hours, which encompassed all preparation and court appearances. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The fourth expert witness, called by Fordham, testified that she believed the case was “extremely tough” and that the breathalyzer suppression theory was novel. She testified that, although the time and labor consumed on the case was more than usual in defending an OUI charge, the hours were not excessive. They were not excessive, she explained, because the case was particularly difficult due to the “stakes [and] the evidence.” She conceded, however, that legal issues in defending OUI charges are “pretty standard” and that the issues presented in this case were not unusual. Furthermore, the witness testified that challenging the breathalyzer test due to the .02 discrepancy was not unusual, but the theory on which Fordham proceeded was novel. Finally, she stated that she thought she may have known of one person who might have spent close to one hundred hours on a difficult OUI case; she was not sure; but she had never heard of a fee in excess of $10,000 for a bench trial.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In considering whether a fee is “clearly excessive” . . . the first factor to be considered pursuant to that rule is “the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly.” . . . Based on the testimony of the four experts, the number of hours devoted in Timothy’s OUI case by Fordham and his associates was substantially in excess of the hours that a prudent experienced lawyer would have spent. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Another] factor to be considered in ascertaining the reasonableness of a fee is its comparability to “[t]he fee customarily charged in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page828" class="pagebreak" title="828">828</span>locality for similar legal services.” The hearing committee made no finding as to the comparability of Fordham’s fee with the fees customarily charged in the locality for similar services. However, one of bar counsel’s expert witnesses testified that he had never heard of a fee in excess of $15,000 to defend a first OUI charge, and the customary flat fee in an OUI case, including trial, “runs from $1,000 to $7,500.” Bar counsel’s other expert testified that he had never heard of a fee in excess of $10,000 for a bench trial. In his view, the customary charge for a case similar to Timothy’s would vary between $1,500 and $5,000. One of Fordham’ s experts testified that she considered a $40,000 or $50,000 fee for defending an OUI charge “unusual and certainly higher by far than any I’ve ever seen before.” The witness had never charged a fee of more than $3,500 for representing a client at a bench trial to defend a first offense OUI charge. She further testified that she believed an “average OUI in the bench session is two thousand [dollars] and sometimes less.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although finding that Fordham’s fee was “much higher than the fee charged by many attorneys with more experience litigating driving under the influence cases,” the hearing committee nevertheless determined that the fee charged by Fordham was not clearly excessive because Clark “went into the relationship with Fordham with open eyes,” Fordham’s fee fell within a “safe harbor,” and Clark acquiesced in Fordham’s fee by not strenuously objecting to his bills. The board accepted the hearing committee’s analysis apart from the committee’s reliance on the “safe harbor” rule. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is also significant, however, that the hearing committee found that “[d]espite Fordham’s disclaimers concerning his experience, Clark did not appear to have understood in any real sense the implications of choosing Fordham to represent Timothy. Fordham did not give Clark any estimate of the total expected fee or the number of $200 hours that would be required.” The express finding of the hearing committee that Clark “did not appear to have understood in any real sense the implications of choosing Fordham to represent Timothy” directly militates against the finding that Clark entered into the agreement “with open eyes.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, bar counsel challenges the hearing committee’s finding that “if Clark objected to the numbers of hours being spent by Fordham, he could have spoken up with some force when he began receiving bills.” Bar counsel notes, and we agree, that “[t]he test . . . is whether the fee ‘charged’ is clearly excessive, not whether the fee is accepted as valid or acquiesced in by the client.” Therefore, we conclude that the hearing committee and the board erred in not concluding that Fordham’s fee was clearly excessive.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Fordham argues that our imposition of discipline would offend his right to due process. . . . Fordham contends that the bar and, therefore, he, have not been given fair notice through prior decisions of this court or the express language of [the relevant Rule] that discipline may be imposed for billing excessive hours that were nonetheless spent diligently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page829" class="pagebreak" title="829">829</span>and in good faith. . . . [However,] charging a clearly excessive fee, Fordham departed substantially from the obligation of professional responsibility that he owed to his client. The ABA Model Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions § 7.3 (1992) endorses a public reprimand as the appropriate sanction for charging a clearly excessive fee. We deem such a sanction appropriate in this case.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Notice that Rule 1.5(a), printed above, sets forth numerous factors that bear on whether a fee is reasonable or, alternatively, excessive. Do you agree with the list? The <a id="dabmci_55c0be628b884719a6c43f2e344a5240" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span> § 34, comment c provides that, in addition to the eight factors identified by Rule 1.5: “Other factors might also be relevant, such as the client’s sophistication, the disclosures made to the client, and the client’s ability to pay.” According to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span>:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Those factors might be viewed as responding to three questions. First, when the contract was made, did the lawyer afford the client a free and informed choice? Relevant circumstances include whether the client was sophisticated in entering into such arrangements, whether the client was a fiduciary whose beneficiary deserves special protection, whether the client had a reasonable opportunity to seek another lawyer, whether the lawyer adequately explained the probable cost and other implications of the proposed fee contract, whether the client understood the alternatives available from this lawyer and others, and whether the lawyer explained the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed legal services without misleading intimations. Fees agreed to by clients sophisticated in entering into such arrangements (such as a fee contract made by inside legal counsel in behalf of a corporation) should almost invariably be found reasonable.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Second, does the contract provide for a fee within the range commonly charged by other lawyers in similar representations? To the extent competition for legal services exists among lawyers in the relevant community, a tribunal can assume that the competition has produced an appropriate level of fee charges. A stated hourly rate, for example, should be compared with the hourly rates charged by lawyers of comparable qualifications for comparable services, and the number of hours claimed should be compared with those commonly invested in similar representations. The percentage in a contingent-fee contract should be compared to percentages commonly used in similar representations for similar services (for example, preparing and trying a novel products-liability claim). . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Third, was there a subsequent change in circumstances that made the fee contract unreasonable? Although reasonableness is usually assessed as of the time the contract was entered into, later events might be relevant. Some fee contracts make the fee turn on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page830" class="pagebreak" title="830">830</span>later events. Accordingly, the reasonableness of a fee due under an hourly rate contract, for example, depends on whether the number of hours the lawyer worked was reasonable in light of the matter and client. It is also relevant whether the lawyer provided poor service, such as might make unreasonable a fee that would be appropriate for better services, or services that were better or more successful than normally would have been expected. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As noted above, professional discipline for the charging of excessive fees is very rare. Rather than professional discipline, bar authorities have viewed the appropriate remedy to be malpractice claims, breach of contract actions, or defenses in litigation by attorneys to collect their fees. Yet, as Chapter 3 notes, these self-help mechanisms are far from perfect. What, if anything, might be better?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Under what circumstances should courts and bar disciplinary counsel protect clients from fee agreements that they have freely, but foolishly, accepted? In the absence of fraud, deceit, or coercion, we do not generally police the price of goods or services. Is it unfair to single out lawyers for special regulation? Consider the following claim:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[O]ne searches . . . in vain to discover precisely why a lawyer, acting without deceit, without coercion, and without any other form of untoward conduct is not free to price legal services at what a client is willing to pay, reasonable or otherwise. Most other actors in the marketplace can do that—why not lawyers? When professional rhetoric is set aside all that is left is an extraordinary, socialist maxim that lawyers should be ashamed of making “too much” money.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1839" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1839" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">178</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree? If so, are there any circumstances in which courts should set aside agreements that clients negotiated with “open eyes?”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Professor Leonard Gross, likewise, suggests that efforts to police fees are futile and misdirected. Gross argues:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">[T]he public already thinks that lawyers often gouge their clients. Whether courts reduce or eliminate fees in a few selected cases will hardly make a difference. Second, it does not matter whether the public thinks that lawyers in general overcharge. What matters is how that opinion might impact people’s conduct. As long as clients are happy with their own attorneys, and as long as clients do not refuse to retain counsel because of the belief that all lawyers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page831" class="pagebreak" title="831">831</span>overcharge, there is no reason to worry about how fees affect the public’s view of lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1840" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1840" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">179</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">What is your view? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should nonrefundable retainers be prohibited? These retainers generally take one of two forms. One is an “engagement” fee or “general retainer,” which is a deposit by the client to assure that the attorney will handle the matter. Lawyers earn this fee at the moment they lend their name to the case; such a fee is said to compensate for the attorney’s reputation, commitment to the client, and reservation of future time. A second type of nonrefundable fee is a “special” retainer. When there is a “special” retainer, services are billed against that initial sum, but, at the conclusion of the case, the attorney keeps any part of the retainer that has not yet been charged.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Several jurisdictions prohibit certain types of nonrefundable fees. In one leading case, the New York Court of Appeals disallowed a special retainer that would have enabled a divorce lawyer to collect substantial sums for little or no work. In the court’s view, “nonrefundable retainer fee agreements diminish the core of the fiduciary relationship by substantially altering and economically chilling the client’s unbridled prerogative to walk away from the lawyer.” <a id="dabmci_7b337c712b374180917d6dfea48e99ac" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Cooperman, Matter of&quot; \s &quot;A;O;19;dabmci_7b337c712b374180917d6dfea48e99ac_1;I822be138da2111d983e7e9deff98dc6f;;0;S;Matter of Cooperman, 633 N.E.2d 1069, 1072–73 (N.Y. 1994)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Matter of Cooperman</span>, 633 N.E.2d 1069, 1072–73 (N.Y. 1994). “To answer that the client can technically still terminate,” said the court, “misses the reality of the economic coercion that pervades such matters. If special nonrefundable retainers are allowed to flourish, clients would be relegated to hostage status in an unwanted fiduciary relationship—an utter anomaly.” <a id="dabmci_6557deec1ec945ee8c41e0f3f2a36068" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>.

Telex Corp.</span>, 602 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1979), the court enforced a $1 million fee ($4.2 million in current dollars) for services that turned out to involve filing one petition for certiorari. The case arose from antitrust proceedings in which Telex obtained a $259 million judgment against IBM but lost an $18 million counterclaim. On appeal, IBM won reversal of the judgment and affirmance of its counterclaim. In the face of liability substantial enough to bankrupt the company, Telex sought the best available lawyer for its petition to the Supreme Court. The company settled on a partner at Brobeck and agreed to a complicated contract specifying different fees contingent on different outcomes, including an agreement to pay a $1 million fee upon grant of Telex’s petition for certiorari. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari, Telex and IBM reached a settlement in which each dropped their claims, but Brobeck still claimed the right to collect <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page832" class="pagebreak" title="832">832</span>the $1 million fee. In rejecting Telex’s claim that the fee was unconscionable, the court concluded that the contract must be reviewed “with reference to the time it was made and cannot be resolved by hindsight.” <a id="dabmci_b9b15e2ba6f9475291deb6b9c725f5cd" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />602 F.2d at 875. The court elaborated: </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">This is not a case where one party took advantage of another’s ignorance, exerted superior bargaining power, or disguised unfair terms in small print. Rather, Telex, a multi-million corporation, represented by able counsel, sought to secure the best attorney it could find to prepare its petition for certiorari, insisting on a contingent fee contract. Brobeck fulfilled its obligation to gain a stay of judgment and to prepare and file the petition for certiorari. Although the minimum fee was clearly high, Telex received substantial value from Brobeck’s services.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Fee-related abuses fall across a spectrum, reflecting everything from flagrant fraud and “creative timekeeping” to sloppy accounting and inefficient staffing. The frequency of such activity is difficult to gauge, since many abuses constitute the “perfect crime”: It is often impossible, even for sophisticated clients, to verify whether certain tasks are essential and whether the time that lawyers charge for completing them is reasonable or accurate.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Still, the spotty evidence we have suggests that overbilling is anything but exceptional. Auditors summoned to review charges find demonstrable fraud in about 5 to 10 percent of the bills they review and questionable practices (such as overstaffing, performing unnecessary work, and double billing two clients for the same task or time) in another 25 to 35 percent of scrutinized invoices. Similarly, a survey of practicing lawyers reported that only 44 percent of respondents said they were never influenced by the temptation to do more work than the client needed, while 43 percent of respondents believed that at least 10 percent of work by American lawyers is unnecessary. Only half thought double billing was unethical; 64 percent reported never engaging in the practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1841" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1841" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">180</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The basic problem arises from the difference in lawyers’ and clients’ interests. An attorney’s goal is often to maximize profits, while a client’s goal is to maximize value and minimize costs. If lawyers are charging by the hour and lack other equally profitable uses for their time, they have an incentive to prolong projects. When billing patterns also affect power, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page833" class="pagebreak" title="833">833</span>promotion, retention, and compensation within law firms, those incentives intensify. Yet lawyers rarely acknowledge, let alone disclose, the obvious conflicts of interest that the billable hour system creates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1842" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1842" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">181</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The problem is compounded by the amount of work that firms increasingly demand. For many lawyers, quotas hovering around 2,000 hours a year are common.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1843" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1843" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">182</a></span> Most estimates indicate that about a quarter of lawyers’ office time cannot be billed honestly to clients; administrative matters, firm meetings, and personal needs all require attention. Thus, to generate 2,000 billable hours, attorneys typically need to work some nine hours a day, six days a week, with limited vacation. As then-Chief Justice Rehnquist once noted, if lawyers are expected to bill at current levels, “there are bound to be temptations to exaggerate the hours put in.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1844" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1844" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">183</a></span> Or, as associates at Clifford Chance less diplomatically observed in an internal memorandum leaked to the press, the firm’s “profoundly unrealistic” billable hour requirements encouraged “padding of hours, inefficient work, repetition of tasks, and other problems.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1845" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1845" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">184</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the face of such pressures, rationalizations for inflating charges come readily to hand. Studies of billing abuses find that lawyers often insist that their work really was “worth more” than the time it required. Others use upward “adjustments” to compensate for hours they assume they forget to claim. Some associates acknowledge padding if the client is “a jerk,” has deep pockets, or has agreed to an estimated charge.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1846" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1846" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">185</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Making matters worse, internal law firm procedures are not always adequately structured to deter or police fee-related misconduct. In surveys of associates, only 40 percent indicated that their firms had written billing guidelines; roughly a third to a half of associates reported that they received little or no instruction on fee-related practices.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1847" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1847" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">186</a></span> When the issue is padding or meter running, supervising lawyers too often look the other way or fail to look at all.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, in the rare instances when significant misconduct comes to light, substantial responses seldom follow. For example, when email chatter between associates at DLA Piper became public, in which one associate boasted, “That bill shall know no limits,” the firm shook it off <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page834" class="pagebreak" title="834">834</span>as an “inexcusable effort at humor.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1848" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1848" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">187</a></span> These justifications are apparently commonplace. In one survey of lawyers convicted of billing fraud, fewer than half of firms reported the associate’s or partner’s criminal conduct to bar disciplinary authorities or prosecutors.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1849" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1849" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">188</a></span> In most cases, the only penalty for excessive fees is a reduction of charges or reimbursement for overpayments, coupled with a loss of future business or favorable recommendations from the client. Given the low probability of detection, many believe that such sanctions provide inadequate deterrence. At the same time, however, the mistrust surrounding billing has often strained lawyer-client relationships and has given rise to the proliferation of new firms that specialize in “disputing others’ bills—as well as in-house nudniks who demand copious details and then flyspeck them.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1850" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1850" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">189</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In response to these problems, commentators generally recommend more stringent oversight, stiffer penalties, and greater experimentation with alternative billing. Some courts agree and have required lawyers to forfeit all or most of their fees in cases of serious ethical abuse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1851" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1851" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">190</a></span> Most experts also recommend that all firms establish policies, training, and oversight structures to create internal cultures of billing integrity, which are likely to be more effective than sanctions in dealing with hard-to-detect abuses.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1852" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1852" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">191</a></span> The ABA’s Commission Report on Billable Hours identifies best and worst practices to guide that effort. Among the best practices is a policy emphasizing that an “absolute requirement and condition of continued employment [is] that lawyers be scrupulously honest in recording time” and that “violators will be terminated.” Among the worst practices are policies that tie lawyers’ compensation to hours worked, irrespective of the work’s quality.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1853" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1853" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">192</a></span> Many experts further recommend that firms found guilty of billing abuse should be required to develop appropriate oversight procedures, including random billing audits, and that lawyers who knowingly fail to report billing fraud should be subject to professional discipline. </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Which, if any, of these reform proposals would you support? How effective do you believe they would be in addressing the problems raised by the preceding reading?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A California lawyer who says he was fired from his firm because he couldn’t meet a quota requiring 3,000 billable hours a year filed suit, claiming that the requirement essentially demanded billing fraud. The suit alleged that he was instructed to charge for his “thinking time” and to bill every task in six-minute increments, even if it involved only reading a brief email.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1854" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1854" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">193</a></span> If the allegations are true, should the lawyer prevail?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Are more innovative billing structures necessary? Many experts believe that alternative billing can help combat the most corrosive aspects of hourly fees, particularly padding, inefficiency, and the devaluation of non-billable activities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1855" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1855" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">194</a></span> These beliefs are starting to translate into changed practices. As of 2017, 97 percent of surveyed firms reported using some sort of alternative fee structure other than an hourly rate on at least some matters.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1856" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1856" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">195</a></span> These alternative models include fixed fees, fees tied to specific measures of success, and volume discounts, among other, more complex arrangements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1857" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1857" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">196</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Costs and expenses constitute another battleground. Per Rule 1.5(a), the lawyer can pass the costs and expenses of litigation to the client, but those costs and expenses must be “reasonable” and must “reasonably reflect[ ] the cost incurred by the lawyer.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1858" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1858" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">197</a></span> As to what qualifies, <a id="dabmci_144c2808d30f46f4a4fcaf3359dc78aa" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Opinion 93–379 (1993) advises that, without clear client consent, “[a] lawyer may not charge a client for overhead expenses generally associated with properly maintaining, staffing and equipping an office,” and “[a] lawyer may not charge a client more than her disbursements for services provided by third parties like court reporters, travel agents or expert witnesses.” In sum, “in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, it is impermissible for a lawyer to create an additional source of profit for the law firm beyond that which is contained in the provision of professional services themselves. The lawyer’s stock in trade is the sale of legal services, not photocopy paper, tuna fish sandwiches, computer time or messenger services.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Still, some practitioners haven’t gotten the message. Minor scandals have surfaced involving corporate law firm spending—with reports of $77.50 faxes, $22 document deliveries, and nearly $9 danishes, all charged to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page836" class="pagebreak" title="836">836</span>clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1859" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1859" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">198</a></span> Meanwhile, running shoes have been billed as “ground transportation,” and dry cleaning for a toupee has been labeled a litigation expense.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1860" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1860" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">199</a></span> In one survey, only 42 percent of surveyed lawyers thought lawyers should not mark up overhead costs billed to clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1861" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1861" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">200</a></span> If you were a corporate client who learned that your law firm engaged in such practices, how would you respond?</p>

Common particularly in personal injury work, these fees were banned for much of the last century, as critics charged that it was unethical and improper for lawyers to “get paid for no work.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1862" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1862" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">201</a></span> Yet, in 1983, the ban was relaxed to reflect the current notion that fees can be shared between lawyers, even if the referring lawyer does not work on the client matter, as long as both lawyers accept joint responsibility for the representation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The impetus to change the rule apparently came from the Annual Chief Justice Earl Warren Conference on Advocacy in 1978. There, participants recommended by a two-to-one margin that referral fees be permitted, provided there is full disclosure to the client. In recommending the change, conferees concluded: (a) that the traditional prohibition on referral fees was flagrantly violated and violations were rarely prosecuted; (b) fee splitting could help clients by encouraging the transfer of their cases to more competent practitioners; (c) there was little or no evidence to suggest that clients pay higher fees under fee-splitting arrangements, particularly since most fee splitting occurs in contingent fee cases where the contingency fee percentage remains the same after transfer; and (d) prohibiting referral fees encouraged attorneys to retain matters that they could not effectively or efficiently pursue, which was detrimental both to clients and the development of substantive law. Some also charged that the traditional prohibition, which affected mostly personal injury practitioners who tended to practice alone or in small firms, reeked of hypocrisy, since defense-side lawyers within the same firm can pass cases around and share fees, irrespective of any formal prohibition.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1863" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1863" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">202</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Attempting to strike a balance of permitting referral fees, while offering adequate protection to clients, Rule 1.5(e) provides:</p>

      <p class="TextFlush">Comment 7 to Rule 1.5 further specifies: “A lawyer should only refer a matter to a lawyer whom the referring lawyer reasonably believes is competent to handle the matter.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Now blessed by Rule 1.5(e), referral fees are extremely prevalent. Many (particularly elite) personal injury lawyers obtain the majority or vast majority of their clients via referral networks, though they pay dearly for these referrals, as referral fees in personal injury cases appear to range between 30 percent and 50 percent of the entire fee generated.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1865" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1865" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">204</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should state bars restrict the fees paid to referring lawyers?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Sara Parikh’s study, “How the Spider Catches the Fly,” offers some empirical support for the current, comparatively lenient, rule on fee splitting. Drawing on detailed interviews with personal injury lawyers, Parikh maps a world of “embedded referral relationships [that] promote trust, efficiency, joint problem solving, and quality.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1866" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1866" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">205</a></span> Unsophisticated clients, she says, need assistance in finding a lawyer who will be willing and competent to handle their case. That assistance is most likely to be forthcoming if lawyers have a financial stake in referring the clients to the right practitioner. Although some personal injury attorneys resented paying colleagues “a lot of money for doing nothing,” most saw the wisdom of the system.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1867" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1867" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">206</a></span> As one lawyer explained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">We live in a world where some lawyers are more capable than others. It is in the client’s best interest to find the most capable lawyer he can to represent him. Unfortunately, the client is not in a very good position to know the difference. . . . So, the public good is really served by the referral system. The likelihood of the ordinary injured person to get to a better lawyer as a result of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page838" class="pagebreak" title="838">838</span>referral system is tremendous. But, it wouldn’t occur nearly as much unless there was some incentive for that mainline, street-location lawyer to do such a thing. (High-end, age 60).</p>
      <p style="margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Referral networks also have an advantage, Parikh finds, because receiving the majority of one’s cases via referrals allows elite personal injury attorneys to “avoid some of the more distasteful means of getting business, such as advertising or chasing cases.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1868" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1868" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">207</a></span> If such findings offer an accurate picture of referral networks, are there any changes in the Model Rules that you would recommend?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Though lawyers can—and frequently do—get compensated for referring cases to one another, nonlawyers are barred from receiving such payments.

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A related and increasingly important issue involves reciprocal referral agreements between lawyers and other service providers. To provide guidance concerning these agreements, the ABA House of Delegates recently adopted an addition to Rule 7.2:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services except that a lawyer may . . .</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 64.8pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(i)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the reciprocal agreement is not exclusive; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 64.8pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(ii)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client is informed of the existence and nature of the agreement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1870" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1870" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">209</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Comment 8 to Rule 7.2 adds that such reciprocal agreements must not interfere with “the lawyer’s professional judgment as to making referrals or providing substantive legal services,” and are subject to the conflicts provisions of Rule 1.7<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.7&quot; " />. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">What kinds of ethical problems might arise under these reciprocal agreements? As a practical matter, are the requirements of non-exclusivity and non-interference with professional judgment enforceable? Would any other protection be appropriate?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the most longstanding controversies surrounding fee regulation involves fees where payment is conditioned on a certain outcome. Early English common law banned contingent fees entirely but, in the United States, such fees have long been accepted. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> <a id="dabmci_38ddc30d0c114640b6f9f212156d9119" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Stanton v.

Embrey</span>, 93 U.S. 548, 556 (1876) (declaring that the legality of such fees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page839" class="pagebreak" title="839">839</span>was “beyond legitimate controversy”). But even though they have long been tolerated—and are now quite prevalent—these fees have prompted continuing criticism and intermittent restrictions. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Defenders of contingent fees generally emphasize four main advantages. Such arrangements:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />give lawyers an incentive to pursue matters competently and diligently, even when the client is unsophisticated and would have difficulty evaluating the quality or quantity of professional services he or she receives;</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />give impecunious clients “keys to the courthouse”—make it so even lower- or middle-class individuals can afford legal assistance;</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />act as insurance against non-recovery—enable clients to shift most or all of the risk of an unsuccessful suit to attorneys, who may be in a better position to bear or spread the loss; and</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />give contingency fee lawyers a strong incentive to screen cases for merit prior to filing, offering what some call the “first line of defense against frivolous litigation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1871" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1871" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">210</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Furthermore, by turning to the contingency fee, plaintiffs (and defendants, in the case of reverse contingency fees) can avoid the myriad problems (discussed above) associated with hourly-rate billing.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">Still, contingency fees are far from perfect. First, though contingency fees better align the client and attorney’s financial interests than either flat or hourly fees, that alignment is still imperfect, generating significant agency costs. The problem is as follows:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[Most] contingency fee [clients] are indifferent to incremental additional expenditures of attorney time and effort. While clients do bear some additional direct costs as a case progresses (such as court costs, travel costs, expert witness fees, and the like), from the client’s perspective, attorney time is costless: The more of it the better. It is in the attorney’s short-term economic interest, meanwhile, to secure the maximum fee with the minimum expenditure of time and effort. To accomplish this goal, attorneys have an incentive to invest in a claim only up to the point at which further investment is not profitable for the firm—a level that may be far below the investment needed to produce the optimal award for the client. Particularly when the plaintiff’s injury is modest and the potential upside is limited, rather than squeezing every dollar out of every case, it is in an attorney’s short-term financial interest to seek a high volume of cases and quickly process each, expending minimal time and resources on case development.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1872" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1872" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">211</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page840" class="pagebreak" title="840">840</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics of contingency fee arrangements also object to fee structures in which a lawyer’s financial return bears little relationship to the effort expended or risk assumed. In cases with straightforward facts, low risk, and large damages, a standard one-third percentage recovery might provide—and, on occasion, has provided—a windfall fee, equivalent to thousands of dollars for each hour worked. Further, critics point out that many clients’ consent to contingency fees is anything but informed. Clients do not typically receive an option of an hourly fee, an indication of how much work their case will require, or a statement at the conclusion of the case indicating the hours worked and the effective hourly fee earned.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1873" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1873" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">212</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>In addition, drawing on insights from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, Nora Freeman Engstrom has shown that the contingency fee is not particularly “salient” to legal consumers, meaning that clients are not particularly sensitive to the percentage fees they’re charged—potentially facilitating abuse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1874" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1874" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">213</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There are several responses to these criticisms. First, in response to charges of windfall fees, the ABA Committee on Professional Ethics questions the prevalence of genuinely risk-free contingency fee cases. As the ABA put it in <a id="dabmci_2f27a85605644e3baba3c179d70db284" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Formal Op. 94–389 (1994):</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[T]he [often-heard criticism] may rest on a faulty notion as to the number of cases regarding which at the onset of the engagement the lawyer can say with certainty that the client will recover. Defendants often vigorously defend and even win cases where liability seems certain. Additionally, a previously undiscovered fact or an unexpected change in the law can suddenly transform a case that seemed a sure winner at the outset of representation into a certain loser.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Moreover, in the same opinion, the ABA also pointed out that, even if a case is easily and expeditiously settled, the contingency fee lawyer might still deserve a significant reward:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">An early settlement offer is often prompted by the defendant’s recognition of the ability of the plaintiff’s lawyer fairly and accurately to value the case and to proceed effectively through trial and appeals if necessary. There is no ethical reason why the lawyer is not entitled to an appropriate consideration for this value that his engagement has brought to the case, even though it results in an early resolution.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Others also note that even seemingly high contingency fees on easy cases may be essential to subsidize other difficult cases that take years to litigate and result in financial outlays of thousands—or tens of thousands—of dollars for out-of-pocket expenses, but that result in no recovery.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page841" class="pagebreak" title="841">841</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Furthermore, scholars assert that any attempt to evaluate contingency fees by looking <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> at hours worked is seriously misleading. Unlike a defense-side law firm lawyer (who really does provide only legal services):</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[T]he contingency fee has always been understood to compensate plaintiffs’ lawyers for a trio of services: (1) professional services (actual lawyering), (2) banking services (advancing to clients the value of the lawyer’s professional services and out-of-pocket expenses), and (3) insurance services (insuring the value of the lawyers’ professional services and out-of-pocket expenses against the risk of non- or inadequate payment). And, it has also always been understood that contingency fee lawyers do—and should—earn higher effective hourly rates than their defense-side counterparts precisely because of the extra services they provide.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1875" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1875" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">214</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, others question the empirical premises on which many criticisms are based: Are contingency fee lawyers, as a group, receiving much higher payments? Leading legal empiricist Herbert Kritzer notes that there is little evidence that the average earnings of contingent fee attorneys are significantly higher than those of counsel who bill hourly.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1876" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1876" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">215</a></span></p>

      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />For decades, critics have complained about excessively high contingency fees and offered various fixes. One proposed solution is to arm clients with objective price and quality information before they sign retainer agreements. The thought is that such price and quality information would naturally spur some price competition, eliminating the need for heavy-handed reforms.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1877" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1877" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">216</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Another idea is to require attorneys to disclose in writing at the conclusion of the representation the actual services performed and the number of hours spent—though critics point out that this requirement would demand that plaintiffs’ lawyers </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;">keep</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> detailed and accurate time records, which, for reasons explored above, might prove difficult. (If lawyers pad bills even when dealing with sophisticated corporate counsel with whom they seek long-term relationships, how can we ensure they will be truthful when presenting time records to unsophisticated, one-shot, individual claimants?) Others suggest that courts could more actively review claimed fees—though, of course, this would (again) impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ bar, as well as the already-overworked judiciary. A number of jurisdictions have also considered a proposal developed by the Manhattan Institute, which limits </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page842" class="pagebreak" title="842">842</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">contingency awards where the plaintiff accepts an early settlement offer.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1878" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1878" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">217</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Others respond, however, that the surest effect of that proposal would be to dramatically reduce the legal representation available to individual, impecunious </span>claimants. Do any <span style="font-size: 10pt;">of these suggested reforms strike you as promising?</span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The most common way to rein in “windfall” fees is to cap them—and numerous jurisdictions have restricted contingency fees, either via a flat cap or via a graduated scale that entitles lawyers to a smaller percentage as a client’s recovery ticks upward.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1879" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1879" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">218</a>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contingency fee caps undeniably prevent windfall fees but at substantial cost, as studies suggest that they discourage lawyers from accepting or fully litigating even meritorious claims. Thus, one prominent study considering the effect of contingency fee caps in medical malpractice claims found that fee ceilings increased the percentage of </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">dropped </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">medical malpractice cases by 5 percent, decreased settlement size by 9 percent, and reduced the proportion of cases litigated to a verdict by 1.5 percent. The authors found that the cases most likely to be affected by contingency fee caps involved cases with only minor injuries or cases with severe injuries but with uncertain evidence of negligence.</span>
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1880" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1880" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">219</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> In addition, some research also suggests that, if the goal of fee caps is really to protect individual plaintiffs, these caps might backfire, as high fees can sometimes benefit individual clients by encouraging greater attorney effort.</span>
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1881" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1881" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">220</a>

      <p style="line-height: 12pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">If the effect of a contingency fee cap is to curb the occasional windfall fee but significantly diminish lawyers’ willingness to take, or fully litigate, risky contingent fee cases, is the tradeoff worthwhile? Who should decide? Does it worry you that the most vocal proponents of contingency fee caps are not consumer groups but, rather, groups that represent corporate, insurance, and defense-side interests—and, thus, those who have the most to gain by curtailing individual’s ability to seek redress?</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Contingency fees are impermissible in two instances: if the legal representation involves domestic relations or if it involves criminal defense. Rule 1.5(d) provides that a lawyer cannot enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof; or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Rule 1.5(d)(1) offers no justification for the ban on contingency fees in domestic relations matters, though a commonly articulated justification was offered more than a century ago in <a id="dabmci_448f0947deac422e88dbe73107e67112" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Jordan v.

      <p style="margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 17.65pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Public policy is interested in maintaining the family relation. The interests of society require that those relations shall not be lightly severed, that families shall not be broken up for inadequate causes, or from unworthy motives; and where differences have arisen which threaten disruption, public welfare and the good of society demand a reconciliation, if practicable or possible.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 17.65pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[Contingency fee contracts in domestic relations matters] tend directly to prevent such reconciliation, and, if legal and valid, tend directly to bring around alienation of husband and wife by offering a strong inducement, amounting to a premium, to induce and advise the dissolution of the marriage ties as a method of obtaining relief from real or fancied grievances which otherwise would pass unnoticed. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Further, since courts can require one spouse to pay the other spouse’s fees out of marital assets, the need for contingency fees, some insist, is not as pressing here as it is in other civil contexts. Even so, the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers has urged that the prohibition be relaxed to ensure that clients don’t forego competent assistance in complex cases.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1884" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1884" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">223</a></span> What is your view?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Similarly, Rule 1.5(d)(2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.5(d)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.5(d)(2)&quot; \c 16 " /> offers no justification for the ban on contingency fees in criminal defense matters, though Ethical Consideration 2–20<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;EC 2–20&quot; \s &quot;2–20&quot; \c 16 " /> of the Model Code explained that contingency agreements are impermissible because the lawyers’ services “do not produce a <span style="font-style: italic;">res</span> with which to pay the fee.” That justification seems shaky, however. Courts have often approved the use of contingency arrangements in civil suits that do not create a <span style="font-style: italic;">res.</span> Moreover, in criminal matters, legal representation that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page844" class="pagebreak" title="844">844</span>prevents forfeiture of assets or incarceration <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> increase defendants’ ability to pay. Some commentators have suggested that something else might justify the ban.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1885" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1885" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">224</a></span> Why might contingency fees be problematic in the criminal justice context? As you consider this question, recall that an advantage of the contingency fee, in the civil justice context, is that it encourages lawyers to screen cases carefully for merit, only accepting those clients with “winning” claims and strong entitlements to relief. Might this screening, so salutary in the civil context, be problematic when applied to criminal defendants?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Reflecting corporate clients’ increasing interest in non-hourly-fee billing, some businesses are increasingly opting to pay counsel on a contingency fee model. Douglas Richmond explains: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Today, contingent fees are commonplace in intellectual property and commercial litigation, with law firms of all sizes utilizing them. In one well-publicized case, Wiley Rein LLP, a large general practice firm in Washington, D.C., represented the plaintiff in a patent infringement action against Research in Motion Ltd., which manufactured BlackBerry devices. The case settled for $612.5 million, and Wiley Rein received a contingent fee of more than $200 million. In 2015, Chicago-based general practice firm Schiff Hardin LLP earned a contingent fee of nearly $32 million for successfully representing The Flintkote Co. in litigation against Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. in connection with an asbestos settlement. In 2016, litigation powerhouse Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP received a $70 million contingent fee for its work recovering environmental remediation costs on behalf of a litigation trust created to pursue claims by the federal government and several states against two oil companies. Also in 2016, global law firm K&amp;L Gates LLP, which represented Carnegie Mellon University in lengthy patent litigation against Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and Marvell Semiconductor Inc., earned a $210 million contingent fee when the case settled for $750 million. Houston-based Baker Botts LLP “posted a record year” in 2016, with its revenue elevated by multiple contingent fee representations. Finally, as reported in late 2016, Washington, D.C. litigation boutique Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans &amp; Figel earned a $506.3 million contingent fee from representing the National Credit Union Administration in subprime mortgage litigation against many of the world’s largest banks.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1886" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1886" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">225</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Richmond offers two explanations for the above trend. First, he explains that organizational clients increasingly favor contingency fees because they believe that “[l]inking the lawyer’s compensation to a successful outcome in a matter supposedly encourages the lawyer—who has ‘skin in the game’—to be more creative, efficient, and result-oriented than she might be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page845" class="pagebreak" title="845">845</span>otherwise.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1887" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1887" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">226</a></span> Second, “large law firms are warming to contingent fee engagements because some cases are potentially much more lucrative on a contingent fee basis than they would be if the firm billed by the hour.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1888" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1888" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">227</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you assess the reasonableness of “reverse” contingent fees for defense counsel in civil cases? In such contexts, the contingency fee rests not on the amount of money the client recovers, but rather, on the amount of money that a client (typically, the defendant) <span style="font-style: italic;">saves</span> owing to the lawyer’s labors. This savings is notoriously tricky to calculate. Do you see why?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><a id="dabmci_99b16f72cf11482b895544bfd0f82656" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />In Formal Opinion 93–373<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Formal Opinion 93–373&quot; \s &quot;Formal Opinion 93–373&quot; \c 16 " /> (1993), the ABA acknowledged the difficulty of calculation but held that such contingency agreements are nevertheless permissible if the amount saved is “reasonably determinable,” the fee is “reasonable in amount,” and the client’s agreement is “fully informed.” In addition, the Committee emphasized, “it is incumbent on the defendant’s lawyer to fairly evaluate [a] plaintiff’s claim” and to provide a reasonable estimate of potential liability from which to assess any savings. What problems do you anticipate under such an approach? Are the risks offset by potential advantages?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1889" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1889" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">228</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What happens if a client wants to fire a contingency fee lawyer? Clients are generally free to fire lawyers, even without “cause.” As a classic case put it: “That the client may at any time for any reason or without any reason discharge his attorney is a firmly established rule which springs from the personal and confidential nature of the relation which such a contract of employment calls into existence.” <a id="dabmci_d0b9e50062db46049442b03fc7510abb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Martin v. Camp&quot; \s &quot;A;O;14;dabmci_d0b9e50062db46049442b03fc7510abb_1;Ie137ee81d78d11d99439b076ef9ec4de;;0;S;Martin v. Camp, 114 N.E. 46, 47–48 (N.Y. 1916)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Martin v. Camp</span>, 114 N.E. 46, 47–48 (N.Y. 1916). Rule 1.16, comment 4 formalizes this position, providing: “A client has a right to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer’s services.” What happens, then, when a client exercises that right before a contingency fee case is over? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Generally, if the attorney is discharged by a dissatisfied client, the attorney will be entitled to recover in quantum meruit, which is Latin for “as much as he has deserved.” (Quantum meruit recoveries are generally calculated by reference to the number of hours worked multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1890" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1890" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">229</a></span>) If the client discharges the attorney shortly before settlement, so as to deprive an attorney of a contingent fee that was all but earned, courts will sometimes allow the attorney to receive a full contractual amount rather than quantum meruit. If the latter were not the rule, what might clients be tempted to do? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">An issue that arises is the following: What happens when the plaintiff’s ultimate recovery is delayed, smaller than expected, or zero? On this, one commentator writes:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">One issue that is not entirely resolved is whether the contract percent is a cap on the discharged attorney’s recovery. That is, is the discharged attorney limited to the percentage of the underlying <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page846" class="pagebreak" title="846">846</span>recovery set by his contingent fee and, therefore, a zero recovery if the client recovers nothing in the underlying, action? Some jurisdictions . . . regard the occurrence of the contingency in the underlying suit as essential to the discharged attorney’s recovery and limit that recovery to the contract price, i.e., the contingent fee percentage applied to the recovery. Others have allowed the discharged attorney to sue at once for quantum meruit, thereby deeming the realization of the contingency and the amount actually recovered by the client as irrelevant in determining the quantum meruit fee. [States which take this approach include Illinois, Minnesota, New York, and Washington.] Still other courts, determining the discharged attorney’s fees after the client has recovered in the underlying suit, have allowed the attorney to recover in excess of the contract price.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1891" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1891" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">230</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">What outcome do you think is proper? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Low- and middle-income plaintiffs have trouble paying attorneys’ fees upfront—hence, the contingency fee. They also have trouble bearing the costs and expenses of litigation, which can often run into thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of dollars. As a consequence, many contingency fee attorneys front these litigation expenses on behalf of their clients and demand repayment if—and only if—there is a sufficient recovery. If the case is lost, the lawyer typically absorbs the out-of-pocket investment. Rule 1.8(e) permits this arrangement, providing that the repayment of fees and costs “may be contingent on the outcome of the matter.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">It was not always thus. The Canons and then the Model Code obligated the client to repay her debt to the lawyer, in full, even if her case resulted in no recovery. The Model Code’s repayment provision was apparently discarded after lawyers and bar associations came to terms with the futility and inhumanity of seeking reimbursements from injured, defeated, and typically poor clients—and it also came to be known that the requirement was very frequently disobeyed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1892" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1892" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">231</a></span> Still, though, a minority of states continue to require even losing clients to remain “ultimately liable for such expenses.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1893" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1893" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">232</a></span> Is there any justification for that approach?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Evaluate the following analysis and criticism of contingency fees:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[T]he essence of the contingency fee is that it represents a kind of litigation insurance. . . . The crucial point . . . is that successful clients will pay their lawyers more than they would under alternative [hourly] fee arrangements, while unsuccessful clients pay their lawyers nothing. In effect, then, the lawyer—like an insurance company—subsidizes unsuccessful litigants out of premium revenues collected from successful clients. The extra emoluments paid by successful litigants amount to insurance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page847" class="pagebreak" title="847">847</span>premiums, insuring them against the possibility of failure. The contingency fee is at bottom a risk-spreading device. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[However, t]he American-style percentage contingency fee . . . is an irrational method of distributing risk. Clients with higher awards pay higher fees to subsidize losers’ losses. If we assume that higher awards are entirely compensatory—no punitive damages—and that they represent the client’s actual damages, then the situation is this: the client who has suffered the greatest damages pays the largest number of dollars to subsidize unsuccessful litigants. He who has suffered the most pays the most—it is hard to imagine a justification for such a distributive principle.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1894" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1894" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">233</a></span></p>

Dowd referred her to a Chicago firm, under a contract entitling him to a hefty referral fee. Two years later the firm advised Corcoron to settle the case for the same amount and agreed to take no fee. Dowd sued for his share, and the court of appeals granted his claim.

      <p class="TextParagraph">One reason that plaintiffs (and plaintiffs’ counsel) gravitate to class actions and joint representation is that, as a practical matter, some claims are simply too small to be individually litigated. A similar issue arises in the automobile accident context. After being injured in an auto accident, compensation is often needed to defray the cost of medical care and to compensate victims for lost wages. Many defendants, meanwhile, may be slow or reluctant to pay, suggesting legal representation is required. Yet personal injury lawyers, paid almost exclusively pursuant to contingency fees, often shy away from this kind of low-stakes (and low-return) representation.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page848" class="pagebreak" title="848">848</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In a recent series of articles, Nora Freeman Engstrom suggests that a new breed of personal injury law firm has developed to fill this niche.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1896" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1896" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">235</a></span> She calls these firms settlement mills. According to Engstrom, settlement mills are high-volume personal injury law firms that aggressively advertise and settle what are generally low-value auto accident claims in a routinized manner. Based on Engstrom’s account, it appears that settlement mills practice law in a way that turns much of what we know about the traditional practice of law on its head. Three settlement mill traits particularly stand out. First, at these firms, the practice of law is viewed as a business, rather than a profession. As one settlement mill partner put it, he “always . . . approached this as a business first and a law firm second.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1897" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1897" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">236</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, the focus at settlement mills is not on the litigation—or the trial—of claims. The focus is squarely on claim settlement. Indeed, a few of the firms Engstrom has studied apparently <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> tried a case to verdict despite settling, literally, thousands of claims.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1898" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1898" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">237</a></span> This settlement focus, meanwhile, is sometimes maintained by quotas or contests. Settlement negotiators, who may or may not be lawyers, must settle a given number or dollar value of claims within a particular time period, or are offered rewards or prizes for doing so. One firm in Louisiana, for example, used a series of carrots and sticks to spur settlements. At that firm, nonlawyers negotiated settlements, and their compensation was tied to fees they generated. The firm bestowed a monthly lion award on the highest fee generator (to reward the king of the jungle) and gave a monthly “monkey” award to the lowest fee generator, who was said to have a “monkey on his back.” The firm also sponsored group contests, in which, if the negotiators generated a particular amount in fees during a particular period, everyone in the firm would receive group trips to exotic locales.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1899" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1899" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">238</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Claims’ settlement values reflect mills’ distance from the formal law. Claim values, that is, are not based on an individualized assessment of how the claim would fare at trial<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span>but are instead based on formulaic going rates worked out over time by insurance adjusters and settlement mill negotiators over the course of recurring negotiations. These going rates largely disassociate a claim’s substantive merit from its worth and cluster claim values within established parameters. As a settlement mill negotiator reported:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[E]ver[y] case has a potential value. These little soft tissue injury cases, two- or three-month duration cases, there isn’t a senior adjuster in town that doesn’t have a very set number. . . . <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page849" class="pagebreak" title="849">849</span>[Y]ou know going in and they know going in about the value of this case.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1900" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1900" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">239</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Settlement mills’ third particularly distinctive trait is the lack of emphasis on traditional “lawyering.” At these firms, there is very little legal research, factual investigation of claims, and substantive interaction with clients. In fact, at some settlement mills, it is not unusual for lawyers and clients never to meet.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1901" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1901" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">240</a></span> Meanwhile, the lawyers at settlement mills tend to describe the work as being very routinized and mechanized:</p>

      </ul>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In many of these mills, rule violations abound. In delegating the settlement of claims to nonlawyers, settlement mills may violate Rule 5.5, which outlaws the unauthorized the practice of law. Some (like the Louisiana firm discussed above) share fees with nonlawyers, in violation of Rule 5.4. Some appear to charge unreasonably high contingency fees in relation to the effort exerted, in violation of Rule 1.5(a). Some keep clients so thoroughly in the dark that they violate Rules 1.4 and 1.2(a), which require reasonable communication. Some appear to facilitate claiming for non-meritorious, exaggerated, or fabricated claims, in violation of Rules 3.1 and 8.4. Finally, all settlement mills arguably fall below Rule 1.1’s minimal threshold of competence. Yet, these firms clearly provide some benefits. In the excerpt below, Engstrom explains why.</p>

      <p class="FileLine"><a id="dabmci_3019cb0ec45f4deaa4af96a48644a177" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />86 New York University Law Review 805, 824–33 (2011).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Many] deride the traditional tort system for, inter alia, (1) maintaining high transaction costs, (2) delaying compensation, (3) clogging courts, (4) delivering unpredictable lottery-like awards, [and] (5) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page850" class="pagebreak" title="850">850</span>denying compensation to many needy claimants. . . . [Notwithstanding their many flaws, settlement mills alleviate all five of these concerns.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[First, many commentators] criticize the tort system for being “inordinately expensive to administer,” with transaction costs consuming roughly half of every dollar. Settlement mills are notable, then, for delivering compensation more cheaply. This savings is largely traceable to the fact that settlement mills file lawsuits far less frequently than most other, even high-volume, personal injury practitioners. No lawsuit, of course, means that defense counsel need not be retained and also that court costs, deposition costs, or expert witness fees need not accrue. RAND researchers estimate that such costs often consume about three percent of plaintiffs’ ultimate recovery, and, when auto accident victims do file lawsuits, defense attorneys’ fees and costs average roughly $9900. This means that, by rarely filing suit, settlement mills generate significant savings.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Second, some fault the tort system for being] bedeviled by long delays. Although waits vary by case type and by jurisdiction, tort cases typically take over two years to litigate to a judgment or verdict, and studies suggest that delays are often substantial, even in seemingly straightforward auto cases and even in the absence of trial.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Settlement mills, then, are next notable for delivering compensation more quickly—usually within two to eight months. Part of this rapid resolution, perhaps a large part, flows naturally from the fact that settlement mill claimants’ injuries tend to be modest, and modest claims tend to be more rapidly resolved. . . . Still, even accounting for claim size, it appears that settlement mills resolve claims with relative speed—and this is no small feat. Almost half a century ago, one leading observer of the tort system wrote, “The speeding up of settlements . . . would do more to relieve the distress of injury victims than any other conceivable change in tort law administration.” By delivering relatively prompt compensation, settlement mills undoubtedly spare clients, many of whom lack adequate first-party protection and maintain only thin financial cushions, significant financial and emotional distress.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Third, [some criticize auto cases as being] the major cause of court congestion” and seek to remove such cases from the formal legal system in order to free courts “from their bondage to the automobile.” Settlement mills, by rarely filing lawsuits, accomplish much the same. And, of course, to the extent that settlement mills siphon disputes from the court system, society also saves (at least financially). The average public expenditure per case filed is roughly $1000, and the average public expenditure per trial probably reaches five figures.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Fourth, [many critics] deride the tort system as a “litigation lottery”: a haphazard and unpredictable “game of chance,” where “[o]ne seriously injured party may recover nothing at all . . . while another similarly injured receives an award far in excess of his actual loss.” And though the indictment is often overblown, it is true that the tort system is known <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page851" class="pagebreak" title="851">851</span>to compensate claimants with similar injuries quite differently. . . . For various reasons, this unpredictability is problematic. It is troubling from a theoretical perspective, as it is contrary to horizontal equity—the elemental notion of justice that like victims should be treated in a like fashion. It creates legal and practical difficulties for defendants, as it is difficult to invest in the “right” level of precaution or obtain adequate insurance ex <a id="dabmci_d229c2cc7d5e4922a46cdd54d9de02bb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ante without some estimate of the liability in store ex post. And the practical consequences for the seriously injured plaintiff who receives nothing after mounting a protracted court challenge may be nothing short of dire.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Against this backdrop, settlement mills provide relative certainty. . . . Partly traceable to small claim size (which, at least in the short run, makes it cheaper for the insurer to pay something as opposed to contesting liability), and partly traceable to repeat-play dynamics (since settlement mills’ high case volumes ensure frequent adjuster-negotiator interaction), even cases with serious liability issues are often amicably resolved. Insurers will offer something (as opposed to an outright denial) for nearly every claim. As a nonlawyer negotiator from a Louisiana firm explained, “If it was a real legal dispute, sometimes, you know, [the insurance adjuster] would mention that fact or say, ‘Well, look, just to make this thing go away, I’m still willing to give you $5,000, $6,000.’ ” A negotiator from [another settlement mill] meanwhile recalled:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">I remember getting a file from one of the paralegals, the statute [of limitations] had run like two days over. I knew the adjuster very, very well. Had dealt with him on several other cases. I asked him to do me—it wasn’t my case—to do me a big favor, let’s settle this as three days earlier before the statute ran, and he did.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is not just that settlement mills are apt to provide something as opposed to nothing. . . . [S]ettlement values are also relatively predictable. Settlement mills tend to settle cases for formulaic “going rates”—<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> values worked out over time between the settlement mill and insurance adjuster, often calculated based on the medical bills the claimant has accumulated. Guided by going rates, according to one settlement mill negotiator, “you know going in and [the adjusters] know going in about the value of this case.” “[S]omebody who gets a whiplash,” another explained, “they’re all the same, almost the same. . . . The combined effect of settlement mills’ ability to (1) virtually assure some payment and also (2) roughly predict the amount of that payment means that settlement mills are able to smooth the peaks and valleys of recovery, increasing the likelihood that, at least intra-firm, similar claims will be treated similarly. The litigation lottery concern that so troubles [tort critics], in short, is largely solved.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Fifth, [many] criticize the tort system for leaving so many accident victims uncompensated. . . . In their own unique way, settlement mills <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page852" class="pagebreak" title="852">852</span>might fulfill this objective as well. . . . [One way they do this is] by funding advertising campaigns that encourage more individuals to file claims and retain counsel following an accidental injury. . . . [Another way settlement mills expand the pool of compensated claimants is by] giving the minimally injured—a group Steven Croley has dubbed “an important set of underrepresented civil litigants”—access to counsel that they might otherwise lack.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If settlement mills violate ethical rules fairly regularly, why do you suppose they are able to keep operating? What might prevent ethical violations from coming to the attention of regulatory authorities?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Many settlement mills promise close attorney-client relationships and individualized attention. For example, the law firm of E. Eric Guirard and Associates, which was in operation until the disbarment of Guirard and his partner in 2009, gave clients the “E Guarantee,” which promised: “Your case will be assigned to an attorney!” despite the fact that most cases were handled by non-attorney case managers. In its decision to disbar Guirard and his partner, the Louisiana Supreme Court noted that advertisements like the “E Guarantee” were a “misrepresentation by omission to the clients.”<span class="FootnoteReference"> <a id="ftnb.1903" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1903" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">242</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You are part of the marketing staff at a settlement mill. Management has asked you to come up with a marketing campaign that will avoid the trouble that E.

      <p class="TextParagraph">A final, related set of questions involves whether attorneys or third parties should be able to purchase interests in litigation and profit therefrom. Currently, there is a rise in third-party litigation finance, sometimes called “alternative litigation finance,” or ALF. These funding arrangements typically take one of three forms:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page853" class="pagebreak" title="853">853</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextFlush">1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Consumer legal funding</span>, which involves nonrecourse loans to individual low- and middle-income personal injury plaintiffs, typically for living expenses (such as housing and medical care) to tide the plaintiff over, while he or she is awaiting case resolution. This funding is typically for relatively small sums, often a few thousand dollars. Because these funding arrangements are “nonrecourse,” if the claim is not successful, the plaintiff need not pay the funder back. However, financing charges are high, often exceeding 100 percent a year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1904" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1904" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">243</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextFlush">2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Investments in commercial lawsuits</span> (business versus business), such as loans typically provided by Juridica Investments and Burford Capital. These investments tend to be for large sums (sometimes, millions of dollars) and can benefit either plaintiffs or defendants.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1905" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1905" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">244</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextFlush">3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Lawyer lending</span>, which involves loans to plaintiffs’ personal injury lawyers and law firms to finance case preparation—that is, to cover the costs and expenses of litigation, including travel, medical exams, filing fees, and payments to expert witnesses, investigators, and consultants. Some lawyer lenders offer nonrecourse loans, while the majority offer recourse loans, such that the funder has to be paid back (plus a financing charge of roughly 15 to 20 percent), regardless of whether the lawyer’s case or cases ultimately succeed.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These types of funding arrangements hold some obvious advantages. By carefully evaluating claims and diversifying risks, investors can support litigation that is likely to prove meritorious and socially valuable but would otherwise exceed the capacity of parties or individual lawyers to subsidize. Third-party financing can also level the playing field and promote accuracy in adjudication by ensuring that plaintiffs are not systematically outspent—and thus, outgunned—by better-heeled foes.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1906" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1906" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">245</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Finally, consumer legal funding, in particular, gives individual plaintiffs the ability to withstand efforts by insurers and defendants to prolong cases, which might otherwise force impoverished plaintiffs to settle because of financial hardship and economic necessity.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics of third-party financing, on the other hand, worry that it will stir up frivolous and otherwise non-meritorious litigation and permit “legalized loan sharking,” as some funders charge clients seemingly exorbitant rates even when the funder appears to assume little risk.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1907" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1907" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">246</a></span> Critics also charge that these mechanisms constitute improper fee-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page854" class="pagebreak" title="854">854</span>splitting (under Rule 5.4) and run afoul of the ancient doctrines of champerty and maintenance. Others worry that these funding arrangements might cause lawyers to compromise their ethical duties to clients, as lawyers may be tempted to prioritize lenders’ interests over the interests of clients, inadvertently waive the attorney-client privilege, or breach their duty of confidentiality, under Rule 1.6.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1908" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1908" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">247</a></span> Finally, some note that, apart from such ethical arguments, these arrangements are problematic because they just <span style="font-style: italic;">seem</span> improper. There is, opponents insist, “something <span style="font-style: italic;">conceptually</span> wrong” or “distasteful” with third-party financing” because it transforms “a nonmarket good, namely civil justice, into something that can be bought and sold like anything else.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1909" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1909" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">248</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The market for consumer legal funding has proliferated, in part, because Rule 1.8(e) prohibits lawyers from making or guaranteeing loans to clients for medical and living expenses while the client is awaiting case resolution. Under its terms:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(e)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigations, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />a lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Comment 10 explains that lawyers may not make or guarantee loans covering clients’ living expenses “because to do so would encourage clients to pursue law suits that might not otherwise be brought and because such assistance gives lawyers too great a financial stake in the litigation.” A further rationale is that, if such funding were permitted, attorneys would compete for clients based on the generosity of their assistance rather than on the quality of their representation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1910" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1910" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">249</a></span> Additionally, some courts have suggested that the restriction is necessary to “prevent the attorney from acquiring a financial interest in the litigation which might interfere with his/her exercise of independent professional judgment, especially when it comes to deciding whether to settle the case.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1911" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1911" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">250</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">On the other hand, critics of the bar’s position insist that humanitarian assistance is necessary to prevent inadequate compensation and creates no greater danger of conflict of interest than contingent fees.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1912" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1912" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">251</a></span> Based on such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page855" class="pagebreak" title="855">855</span>considerations, a minority of states allow lawyers to advance or guarantee loans for living expenses under certain circumstances. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">An example of this permissive approach is <a id="dabmci_4d48cd421141410ab8965c9ce2fad8dd" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Louisiana State Bar Ass’n v. Edwins</span>, 329 So. 2d 437 (La. 1976). In <a id="dabmci_345cff50ffb94984a7fee8923293b161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Edwins</span>, a lawyer was disciplined for, among other things, providing funds to cover the cost of his client’s surgery for a non-accident related illness. The Louisiana Supreme Court ultimately ruled: “[W]e are unwilling to hold that the spirit or the intent of the disciplinary rule is violated by the advance or guarantee by a lawyer to a client (who has already retained him) of minimal living expenses, of minor sums necessary to prevent foreclosures, or of necessary medical treatment.” The court continued:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">If an impoverished person is unable to secure subsistence from some source during disability, he may be deprived of the only effective means by which he can wait out the necessary delays that result from litigation to enforce his cause of action. He may, for reasons of economic necessity and physical need, be forced to settle his claim for an inadequate amount.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">We do not believe any bar disciplinary rule can or should contemplate depriving poor people from access to the court so as effectively to assert their claim. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cf.</span>, Canon 2: ‘A lawyer should assist the legal profession in fulfilling its duty to make legal counsel available.’ Nor do we see how a lawyer’s guarantee of necessary medical treatment for his client, even for a non-litigation related illness, can be regarded as unethical, if the lawyer for reasons of humanity can afford to do so. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">In our opinion, the better view . . . [is] that the advancement of living expenses [does] not constitute a violation of professional responsibility, so long as: (a) the advances [are] not promised as an inducement to obtain professional employment, nor made until after the employment relationship was commenced; (b) the advances [are] reasonably necessary under the facts; (c) the client remain[s] liable for repayment of all funds, whatever the outcome of the litigation; and (d) the attorney [does] not encourage public knowledge of this practice as an inducement to secure representation of others.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In some ALF funding arrangements (particularly those involving commercial players), the client cedes some decisionmaking authority to the funder, but the funder owes no fiduciary obligation to the client. Some scholars worry that this may encourage conflicts of interest. For example, “funders can push for monetary remedies over non-monetary ones such as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page856" class="pagebreak" title="856">856</span>injunctive relief, declaratory relief, a public apology, a change of an internal policy, or a change in the law.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1913" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1913" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">252</a></span> In addition, “funders can profit not only from the litigation, but also from their access to the plaintiff’s sensitive information.

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The rise of third-party litigation finance has ignited a fierce debate on whether the ancient common law doctrines of maintenance (defined as “helping another prosecute a suit”) and champerty (defined as “maintaining a suit in return for a financial interest in the outcome”) still apply at all and, if they do, whether they restrict third-party investment in litigation.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Several states have reconsidered restrictions on maintenance and champerty in light of modern litigation finance. Results have been mixed. Some have voided litigation funding agreements. <span style="font-style: italic;">See, e.g., </span><a id="dabmci_31aa1c9bdd294057a84602a9da1c5212" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson v. Wright</span>, 682 N.W.2d 671 (Minn. App. 2004). By contrast, others have simply abandoned the ancient common law doctrines.

Righellis</span>, 687 N.E.2d 1224 (Mass. 1997), for example, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held that the common law doctrines of champerty and maintenance would no longer be recognized. In so holding, the court observed that the doctrines had a “checkered history” and that judges had “long abandoned the view that litigation is suspect, and ha[d] recognized that agreements to purchase an interest in an action may actually foster resolution of a dispute.” <a id="dabmci_778a39eaaed54351a6c1f55450a8e701" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />687 N.E. at 1225–27. Similarly, in 2000, the South Carolina Supreme Court announced: “[W]e abolish champerty as a defense. We are convinced that other well-developed principles of law can more effectively accomplish the goals of preventing speculation in groundless lawsuits and the filing of frivolous suits than dated notions of champerty.” <a id="dabmci_e651867a6d8042bfab3f06259bd7b56d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Osprey, Inc. v.

Other states, including Florida and Mississippi, ostensibly preserve the doctrines, but have refused to find that litigation funding agreements fall within their ambit.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1917" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1917" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">256</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Usury laws, which exist in most but not all states,<span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>might serve as an additional impediment to third-party litigation finance. Generally, the elements of usury are: (1) an agreement to lend money; (2) a non-contingent obligation to repay the lender; and (3) greater compensation for the loan than is authorized under the applicable statute. Applying those elements, litigation loans to plaintiffs are typically thought to flunk the second <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page857" class="pagebreak" title="857">857</span>requirement: These loans <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> typically contingent on an event, namely prevailing in the lawsuit. Accordingly, most courts have concluded that the transactions are not limited by states’ usury statutes.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1918" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1918" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">257</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another question, particularly with lawyer lending, is: Who ought to pay? When a lawyer uses a litigation funder to cover case costs and expenses and is obligated to repay the funds advanced <span style="font-style: italic;">plus a fee</span>, the lawyer must either (1) pay the funding company a fee out of his own contingency fee, or (2) have the client pay the funding company a fee out of her recovery as an additional “expense” of litigation, per Rule 1.8(e).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">An important question, though, is whether the second option is ethical. Put differently, if the lawyer incurs financing charges while advancing reasonable litigation “expenses,” are those financing charges also reasonable litigation “expenses” that can be subtracted from a client’s recovery? So far, every state ethics committee to address the issue has said yes; interest deductions are permissible. And, many lenders make the ability to pass—or “deduct”—interest a prime selling point. One prominent funder, Advocate Capital, for example, has boasted on its website that it provides “Case Expense Financing at a Net Cost of Less Than 1%*.” The asterisk notes that 1% is what a law firm would itself pay after transferring “borrowing costs” along to firm clients. Amicus Capital Services similarly has advertised: “Financing under the Amicus program is INTEREST FREE to participating law firms when a case is won. As provided in many state ethics codes, interest expense incurred under the Amicus program is reimbursable to the firm as a cost of litigation.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Notwithstanding state ethics committees’ unanimous acquiescence, it is not clear that the deduction of interest ought to be permitted as a reasonable cost or expense of litigation. What might be some problems? As you answer, consider restrictions on proper costs and expenses of litigation, discussed <span style="font-style: italic;">supra </span>at Section E.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1919" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1919" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">258</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What, if any, information should recipients of litigation funding have to disclose to their adversaries? In 2018, Wisconsin became the first state to require that litigants disclose all litigation funding arrangements in civil cases.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1920" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1920" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">259</a></span> The measure was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which greeted the bill’s passage by stating: “Wisconsin’s law brings litigation funding out of the shadows, so that funders in the state can’t anonymously ‘pull the strings’ of a lawsuit without other parties’ knowledge.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1921" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1921" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">260</a></span> How does the backing of a deep-pocketed financier change a litigant’s incentives? Should a litigant’s adversary be entitled to this information?</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some have started to fund lawsuits, not to make a buck, but, rather, to make a point. Most notably, in 2016, Terry Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, won a $140 million judgment against Gawker, after Gawker published a surreptitiously-recorded video of Mr. Bollea involved in a sexual encounter with the wife of a former friend. The case made news once it came to light that Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel had secretly financed the lawsuit. Thiel said he funded the case because Gawker had published an article in 2007 headlined “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” The Bollea lawsuit, Thiel explained, was “specific deterrence” against publication of articles that Thiel regarded as “painful and paralyzing” to people whom Gawker had “targeted.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1922" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section23.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1922" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">261</a></span> Are you comfortable with this new breed of litigation finance?

      <p class="TextParagraph">You represent an individual physician who is being sued for medical malpractice. The plaintiff convincingly alleges that she was seriously injured in the course of a botched surgery. The physician’s hospital has also been sued under the theory of <span style="font-style: italic;">respondeat superior</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Because liability is so clear and the plaintiff’s injuries are so serious, you are inclined to offer a reasonable and prompt settlement. The hospital’s defense lawyer comes to you, however, and he notes that the plaintiff, a single mother with two small children, is under serious financial strain. She was just an hourly employee at a nearby grocery store, and now, owing to her injuries, she cannot work, and her employment is soon to be terminated. On top of that, she has not been paying her mortgage, so her home is likely to be foreclosed upon within the next year. He suggests you wait the plaintiff out, because, as months pass, her rapidly-deteriorating financial condition will force her to accept a low-ball settlement offer to avoid the home foreclosure.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What do you do? Is playing this waiting game ethical? Even if you find this strategy distasteful, must you present the option to your physician client?</p>

In recognizing the importance of the State’s interest in regulating solicitation of paying clients by lawyers, we are not unmindful of the problem of the related practice, described in <span style="font-style: italic;">Railroad Trainmen</span>, of the solicitation of releases of liability by claims agents or adjusters of prospective defendants or their insurers. Such solicitations frequently occur prior to the employment of counsel by the injured person and during circumstances posing many of the dangers of overreaching we address in this case. Where lay agents or adjusters are involved, these practices for the most part fall outside the scope of regulation by the organized Bar, but releases of settlements so obtained are viewed critically by the courts.</p>
      </div>

Even if unintentionally, the lawyer’s ability to evaluate the legal merit of his client’s claims may falter when the conclusion will affect the lawyer’s income. A valid claim might be settled too quickly, or a claim with little merit pursued beyond the point of reason. These lapses of judgment can occur in any legal representation, but we cannot say that the pecuniary motivation of the lawyer who solicits a particular representation does not create special problems of conflict of interest.</p>

Apparently it was feared that allowing acceptance of such fees might lead to selection of clients and cases for pecuniary reasons. This policy was changed in 1977 to permit local experimentation with the sharing of court-awarded fees between state affiliates and cooperating attorneys. The South Carolina chapter has not exercised that option. We express no opinion whether our analysis in this case would be different had the latter policy been in effect during the period in question.</p>

For instance, the Court suggests that different considerations would arise if Primus herself had received any benefit from the solicitation, or if her income depended in any way on the outcome of the litigation. Likewise, the Court emphasizes that the lawyers conducting the litigation would have taken no share had attorney’s fees been awarded by the court. Finally, the Court points out that Williams had not “communicated unambiguously a decision against litigation,” that the solicitation was not effected in person, and that legal services were offered free of charge. All these reservations seem to imply that a State might be able to raise an absolute prohibition against any of these factual variations, even “[i]n the context of political expression and association.” On the other hand, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ohralik</span>, the Court appears to give a broader reading to today’s holding. “We hold today in <span style="font-style: italic;">Primus</span> that a lawyer who engages in solicitation as a form of protected political association generally may not be disciplined without proof of actual wrongdoing that the State constitutionally may proscribe.”</p>
